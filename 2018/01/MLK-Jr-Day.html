<p>Had Martin Luther King Jr. not been assassinated in 1968, he would have been 88 years old today.</p>

<p>That fact catches me by surprise; he was younger, by a few years, than my grandparents. Growing up white in vast-majority-white small towns in the west and midwest, my knowledge of the civil rights era came from a few pages in my history textbook. Racism was an individual problem, but certainly not one we had. We didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see race.&rdquo; We also didn&rsquo;t happen to interact with many non-white people, and I didn&rsquo;t have friends from other races as a child. The Civil Rights movement seemed to be a historical relic of a less-enlightened time.</p>

<p>I was in college before I began to have an inkling that the Civil Rights movement, despite making some progress, hardly erased the effects of centuries of slavery and decades of legally-enshrined unequal treatment of people of color. And it took even longer to understand racism as not just an individual issue but a systemic one, and to further understand that racism often emerges in more subtle ways than wearing white hoods and burning crosses.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write much about racism because I feel ill-equipped to say anything useful. I&rsquo;m a white middle-class woman who grew up in small western and midwestern towns with little racial diversity and who entered a profession — academia — that for all its progressive stances is not particularly good at welcoming and supporting scholars of color.</p>

<p>And so I stay mostly silent on racism. I don&rsquo;t want to come across as ignorant; as an academic in a humanities field I&rsquo;m painfully aware that I don&rsquo;t have a solid grounding in critical race theory. I also don&rsquo;t want to come across as a white savior; without the lived experience of a person of color, I don&rsquo;t have any authority on the best solutions to the variety of challenges they face.</p>

<p>But I also don&rsquo;t want my silence to come across as cowardice or complicity in racist structures and attitudes.</p>

<p>The Trump presidency has made it painfully clear that many people in America are deeply racist, and willing to be open about their racism. And even more Americans, including over 80% of evangelical Christians, either supported or were willing to overlook Trump&rsquo;s blatant racism and vote for him to lead our nation.</p>

<p>I want to stand against this racism, teach my children that as Christians we must honor other human beings and, as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:1-5&amp;version=NIV">Paul encouraged the Corinthians</a>, value others above ourselves.</p>

<p>I also want to work to make the church a better reflection of the coming kingdom, in which every people group will join together to worship God. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q881g1L_d8">In 1960</a>, Martin Luther King Jr. called Sunday morning &ldquo;the most segregated hour in America.&rdquo; 58 years later, numbers have improved slightly, but according to LifeWay research <a href="http://lifewayresearch.com/2015/01/15/sunday-morning-in-america-still-segregated-and-thats-ok-with-worshipers/">well over 80% of congregations</a> are still made up of primarily one race. The <a href="http://www.thearda.com/ConQS/qs_298.asp">2012 National Congregations Study</a> found that in more than 70% of white evangelical, conservative or fundamentalist churches, African-Americans make up less than 5% of the congregation.</p>

<p>Racism, even racism specifically in the church, is a large problem, and one that will take the concerted efforts of many people to address. So this year, as I work through my non-fiction reading list, I&rsquo;m educating myself about racism and the lived experiences of people of color. I&rsquo;m listening to their narratives, their analysis, their lived experience so that I can remember that my experience is not normative.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading <em>The History of White People</em> by Nell Irvin Painter, and I&rsquo;m moving Christena Cleveland&rsquo;s <em>Disunity in Christ</em> and Drew G. I. Hart&rsquo;s <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen: Changing the Way the Church Views Racism</em> to the top of my to-be-read pile. I read essays by Ta-Nehesi Coates and Roxane Gay (and Marvel&rsquo;s <em>Black Panther</em> comics, with issues written by both).</p>

<p>When I have time, I listen to podcasts: NPR&rsquo;s <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch">podcast</a> is an excellent starting point for understanding issues of race in America (as is the <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/">blog</a>). I&rsquo;ve also started listening to <a href="http://www.podasterystudios.com/truths-table/"><em>Truth&rsquo;s Table</em></a>, hosted by three black women who discuss race and faith in ways that are incredibly enlightening and challenging.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to follow more people of color on Twitter, and as a starting point I recommend Gene Demby (@GeeDee215), one of the hosts of the <em>Code Switch</em>. Christena Cleveland (@CSCleve) and Austin Channing Brown (@austinchanning) are also great resources.</p>

<p>Listening to voices outside of my own experience and tradition as a white person won&rsquo;t solve all social ills, but it is a necessary step. In 2018, will you join with me in working to combat racism and build a church that honors the <em>imago dei</em> in all people? We are all starting from different points, but we must have this (often painful and uncomfortable) discussion in the church if we are to reflect the peace and unity of our resurrection life.</p>
