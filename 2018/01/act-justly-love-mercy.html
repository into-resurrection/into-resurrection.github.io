<p>If progressive Christians have a favorite bible verse, it is most likely <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6:8&amp;version=NIV">Micah 6:8</a>: &ldquo;He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo; But what does it mean to act justly and also love mercy?</p>

<p>Justice and mercy are often seen as opposites, not companions. Yet repeatedly in scripture we see them coming together, as in one of my favorite images of justice and mercy. This one is found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+85&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 85:10</a> (or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+84:11&amp;version=DRA">84:11</a> in the Vulgate, from which I&rsquo;m quoting): &ldquo;Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle ages, these four virtues were personified as the daughters of God, and the meeting and reconciliation between Mercy and Justice was often dramatized as a prelude to the Incarnation. (The image above, from the early fifteenth century, depicts the conflict between Mercy and Truth before the throne of God.)</p>

<p>While the details vary, the main point of contention between Mercy and Truth is whether humanity can be redeemed from their sins (mercy) or must suffer the penalty for their sins (truth). The two are reconciled in Christ, whose death satisfies justice while also providing mercy. Thus mercy and justice, peace and truth, meet through the person of Christ — and without him, they would remain at odds.</p>

<p>This medieval image of the daughters of God was meant to explain salvation through allegory. But it&rsquo;s also instructive as we think about acting justly and loving mercy ourselves: we almost inevitably value one above the other, and bringing them together often seems beyond our human capability.</p>

<hr />

<p>To show how difficult acting justly and mercifully can be, two brief case studies:</p>

<p>First, I came across a story in December about a 19-year-old undocumented immigrant, who while working as a housekeeper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/12/15/a-maid-stole-some-rings-then-returned-them-a-jury-convicted-her-then-paid-her-fine-was-that-right/?utm_term=.03e1d15d1f0a">stole three rings</a> from a home she was cleaning. Although she didn&rsquo;t confess at first, she later did admit to the theft and return the rings. However, under Virginia law, she was still tried and convicted of felony theft. The jury imposed a fine of only $60 — the equivalent of a day&rsquo;s wages for this young woman — and then took up a collection to pay the fine for her.</p>

<p>The woman whose rings were stolen was aghast at the mercy shown to this young woman, arguing that justice was hardly served. The members of the jury felt that the felony conviction was more than enough justice; they wanted to show mercy in determining a low fine, and then paying it themselves.</p>

<p>Was justice served, if the housekeeper faced few consequences for her crime? Was mercy served, if the housekeeper now has a felony on her record because of a youthful mistake?</p>

<p>Case study #2: Andy Savage, megachurch pastor, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/us/tennessee-pastor-sexual-incident-teen-apology-applause/index.html">sexually assaulted a teenage girl</a> twenty years ago when he was leading a youth ministry (he has referred to this as a &ldquo;sexual incident&rdquo;). The woman, Jules Woodson, publicly <a href="http://watchkeep.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/silent-no-more-survivor-of-sexual.html">recounted her story</a> as part of the broader #MeToo movement after privately confronting Savage without receiving a response.</p>

<p>On January 7, during the Sunday morning service at his church, Savage confessed to the &ldquo;incident,&rdquo; claiming to be truly sorry and to be committed to working towards healing. The congregation responded with a standing ovation. (For a thoughtful analysis of this applause and why it is problematic, read <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/january/andy-savages-standing-ovation-was-heard-round-world-because.html">Ed Stetzer&rsquo;s <em>Christianity Today</em> article.</a>)</p>

<p>Savage is facing some consequences, despite his congregation&rsquo;s support; he is taking a leave of absence while Woodson&rsquo;s allegations are independently investigated, and Bethany House has cancelled publication of his book on marriage.</p>

<p>Is justice served by an investigation? Is mercy served by a standing ovation?</p>

<hr />

<p>In Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Portia argues eloquently for mercy for her friend Antonio in the famous speech beginning, &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained; / It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath.&rdquo; Yet only minutes after this passionate plea for mercy, Portia relentlessly tears down the entirety of Shylock&rsquo;s life, from his riches to his religion, reducing him to begging for his life. She has no mercy for the Jewish moneylender.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knows, as he so often does, that we like mercy when it applies to us and ours — but not so much when those unlike us (culturally, socio-economically, religiously) ask for it. Justice is much more appealing in those circumstances.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the sort of post with a neat answer. We can see that mercy and justice meet in the person of Christ, and we can agree that as we become more Christ-like we should seek to both do justice and love mercy. But that is far harder than simply quoting Micah, and in fact it may be impossible for our still-fallen human nature.</p>

<p>We can start by checking our own impulses: to whom do we want to show mercy, and who do we think deserves justice? And what do justice and mercy look like in particular situations? If we are committed to these two often competing virtues, we must be committed to the difficult, complicated, messy work that they entail.</p></div>
