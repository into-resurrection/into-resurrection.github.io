<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a sermon on guns or gun violence.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in God and guns sort of churches (or attended chapel at Liberty University), where I might have been more likely to hear something about guns. But pretty much everywhere in America, guns are a touchy issue due to both the Second Amendment and a culture that glorifies guns and gun violence. It&rsquo;s not surprising that few pastors want to venture into this particular minefield. And yet, as Christians, we need to learn to think theologically about guns.</p>

<p>The political issue of gun control is large and complex, and further complicated by the sheer number of guns in the United States — nearly 90 guns for every 100 people. I&rsquo;m not going to tackle the practical or political side of this issue today, although for those interested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html">Nicholas Kristof&rsquo;s Nov. 6 opinion piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> makes a number of reasonable suggestions. Instead, I want to challenge us as Christians to do a better job of thinking theologically about gun violence. Even when we disagree about gun policies, we Christians can and should have a thoughtful theological grounding as we approach this topic.</p>

<p>The cornerstone for any theology of violence is, obviously, the conviction that life matters, that all humans are created in the image of God and that God cares for each human life — and expects us as Christians to do likewise. But this belief is so broad as to be almost meaningless; it vanishes into arguments about just war or self defense, or claims that the perpetrators of gun violence are mentally ill and thus incapable of moral reasoning. We may all agree that life is valuable, but this belief hasn&rsquo;t forced Christians to confront our own complicity in a culture that glorifies guns and turns a blind eye to the consequences of that glorification.</p>

<p>So we need something beyond valuing life to undergird a theology of guns. I want to suggest three ways to approach this theology: first, understanding the transformation of weapons into life-giving tools in the coming kingdom of God; second, resisting the impulse to fear; and third, rejecting the glorification of guns and gun violence.</p>

<p>Two different prophets in the Old Testament — <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+2:4&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+4:3&amp;version=NIV">Micah</a> — use the image of swords being beaten into plowshares as they describe the coming kingdom of God, a time when God reigns on earth with justice and peace and when war no longer exists. This image of swords and plows not only removes the need for weapons but flips their purpose, transforming tools that bring death into tools that bring life. Further, when Jesus is betrayed and arrested, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26:47-56&amp;version=NIV">he tells Peter</a> that his kingdom will not be inaugurated by a violent conquest but instead by his own submission to violence.</p>

<p>Christians have certainly had many disagreements over centuries about what these passages, and others, mean for our lives. I think a strong case can be made for Christian pacifism, although arguments about just war that allow Christians to use violence in certain situations are, and historically have been, widely accepted in the church. But regardless of our own convictions the use of violence, we must understand that we are longing for a kingdom in which violence has no place, in which we nourish life rather than mete out death. Many Christians see violence as necessary in a fallen world, but we should always approach violence soberly, in the knowledge that it is a product of our sin.</p>

<p>What does this approach to violence mean for a theology of guns? Guns are like swords: their purpose is to kill. They exist to bring death, not life, even if many gun owners never use them outside a firing range. Christians are people of new life, not death, and this conviction should underly our attitude towards guns. On a practical level, Christians should be the most responsible gun owners and should be wary of the proliferation of guns. Guns won&rsquo;t ever be anything other than tools of death, but they can be made safer, harder to obtain, and rarer.</p>

<p>My second approach builds on the first: as Christians, we must reject the culture of fear that encourages gun ownership. One of the most common commands in scripture is &ldquo;fear not&rdquo;: not even death can harm us now that we are in Christ. But fear often spurs gun sales, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/gun-sales-mass-shooting/541809/">now-predictable spike in gun sales</a> that follows mass shootings. The fears vary — of another shooting, of tightened regulations — but the result is more guns and more fear. Christians can reasonably disagree about the use of violence, but we must be vigilant about being manipulated by manufactured fears.</p>

<p>Living in fear leads to distrust and isolation. With the gun issue, we distrust anyone on the opposite side, assuming that they want to leave us vulnerable to harm (which may mean too many or too few guns, depending on the point of view). Brené Brown wrote a wonderful <a href="http://brenebrown.com/blog/2017/11/08/gun-reform-speaking-truth-bullshit-practicing-civility-affecting-change/">article</a> on, among other things, the way we demonize the opposite side in this debate; I would add that our tendency to polarize on this issue arises from fear. In one of his epistles, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&amp;version=NIV">John writes that</a> &ldquo;the one who fears is not made perfect in love.&rdquo; Love leaves no room for fear, but the converse is also true: fear makes love difficult. A culture that encourages us to fear the other (whoever that may be) is incompatible with a culture that tells us to love one another.</p>

<p>For our theology of guns, this means that Christians must guard against fear as a motivation for owning guns. But more than this, we cannot allow fear to poison our relationships with other Christians with whom we disagree. Fear and distrust prevent constructive conversations about guns and gun violence, and Christians should be able to set an example for reasonable, productive dialogue.</p>

<p>Finally, my third approach for a theology of guns requires that we reject the glorification of guns and gun violence. As Americans, we are all complicit in the celebration of violence that permeates our culture, from films to music to sports (and even <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jesus-throw-punches-fight-church-christian-ministries-fight/story?id=25953786">churches</a>). And while the problem of celebrating violence is larger than guns, Clint Eastwood and James Bond demonstrate that guns are often associated with strength and sexual attractiveness. The good guy with a gun is an almost mythic figure revered in American society.</p>

<p>But time and again in scripture, God rejects the glorification of violence and the idolization of the hero. In the Old Testament, God uses the small, the weak, and  the inexperienced to defeat the powerful: David and Goliath, Gideon&rsquo;s tiny army, Jael&rsquo;s defeat of Sisera. And in the New Testament, neither Jesus nor the apostles ever encourage violence as a way of life, as a method of bringing about God&rsquo;s kingdom. Jesus says that the meek and the peacemakers are blessed, not the warriors. Power, physical and otherwise, may be prized by the world, but the kingdom of God subverts these values and exalts the weak instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians should never enjoy a war film or a Bond movie, take a self defense course or serve in the military. But we need to turn a critical eye on violence in American culture and resist the tendency to admire violence. This means swimming upstream against the currents of most human history; modern-day America is hardly unique in its glorification of violence. When it comes to guns, we need to look hard at our motivations: do we intend to use them as tools, albeit deadly ones, or are they accessories to our own ideals of self-reliance, strength or sexiness? Because the latter does not track with the virtues Christians are supposed to cultivate.</p>

<p>The three approaches I&rsquo;ve outlines above are meant as a starting point, not a final word, for a theological framework for guns. All three points can be expanded and their implications on gun policy debated. But gun debates tend to devolve into arguments about safety on the one hand and the Second Amendment on the other. Neither is the right starting point for Christians, and frankly neither addresses the very real legal and social complexities of gun ownership in America. As Christians, we should have a third way, a theological way, of addressing this issue.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all Christians will agree on gun policies. But it should mean that we can approach this topic not out of fear or defensiveness, but in the spirit of peace and charity. In particular, we must remember that guns are tools of death that may be necessary evils now but that we trust will one day be unnecessary. This knowledge combined with a resistance to both fear-mongering and the glorification of gun violence will lay a foundation for real discussions of what gun ownership should look like in America.</p>

<p>Because we live in the hope of a coming kingdom of peace and justice, Christians have every reason to set the tone for this discussion. It&rsquo;s time we step up, regardless of our side on the issue, and do so.</p>
