<p>After all the medieval history, today we take an autumn-appropriate breath with some Old English poetry. The poem partially quoted below, <em>The Ruin</em>, is an elegy, a lament for things lost. Old English poetry has a rich selection of elegies, and this is one of my favorites. It comes from a tenth-century manuscript known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Book">Exeter book</a>, the largest of only a few surviving collections of Old English literature.</p>

<p>The poem itself, in the tradition of an elegy, meditates on ruins and the inevitable decay of all earthly things. In a fittingly poetic twist, the manuscript itself is also damaged, leaving the poem about ruins in ruins.</p>

<p>In a season overrun with decorative gourds and pumpkin spice delicacies that distract us from the coming winter, it&rsquo;s worth reflecting for a moment on falls, on ends, on decay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wondrous is this wall&rsquo;s foundation – <em>wyrd</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has broken</p>

<p>and shattered this city; the work of giants crumbles.</p>

<p>The roofs are ruined, the towers toppled,</p>

<p>frost in the mortar has broken the gate,</p>

<p>torn and worn and shorn by the storm,</p>

<p>eaten through with age. The earth’s grasp</p>

<p>holds the builders, rotten, forgotten,</p>

<p>the hard grip of the ground, until a hundred</p>

<p>generations of men are gone.</p>

<p>This wall, rust-stained</p>

<p>and covered with moss, has endured one kingdom after another,</p>

<p>stood in the storm, steep and tall, then tumbled.</p>

<p>The foundation remains, felled by the weather,</p>

<p>it fell…..<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>grimly ground up ….</p>

<p>……cleverly created….</p>

<p>…… a crust of mud surrounded …</p>

<p>….. put together a swift</p>

<p>and subtle system of rings; one of great wisdom</p>

<p>wondrously bound the braces together with wires.</p></blockquote>

<p>The poem continues with descriptions of the inhabitants of this ruin, proud warriors who succumbed to plague and war despite their joy and bravery while they lived:</p>

<blockquote><p>The slain fell on all sides, plague-days came,</p>

<p>and death destroyed all the brave swordsmen;</p>

<p>the seats of their idols became empty wasteland,</p>

<p>the city crumbled, its re-builders collapsed</p>

<p>beside their shrines. So now these courts are empty,</p>

<p>and the rich vaults of the vermilion roofs</p>

<p>shed their tiles.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Unlike other Old English elegies, <em>The Ruin</em> has no explicitly Christian themes, no reference to the eternal nature of God. It&rsquo;s a poem about a lost civilization (most scholars connect it to the Roman ruins in modern-day Bath), and as such a reminder that all civilizations come to an end. Reading it today, in the twenty-first century, we have an added layer of poignancy: the author and his culture have crumbled into the ruins of history, the poem itself existing in ruins — a memorial, as were the Roman ruins, to those who produced them.</p>

<p>This probably seems like an odd way to end a series that attempts to reclaim the middle ages from those who would distort them in the service of damaging ideologies. And I could have chosen any number of other cultural relics that are more up-beat, more exemplary of the rich and diverse culture of the middle ages.</p>

<p>But at the beginning of this series, I talked about the culture wars as a fight to define and defend western culture — and those actions require that we also preserve western culture. Against this urge for preservation, this poem reminds us that all things end, all things decay; winter always comes, no matter how bountiful the harvest.</p>

<p>And yet something also always remains. The inhabitants of the ruins, like the author of the poem and the copyists of the manuscript, have vanished — but the ruins, the poem, the things themselves, they survive. There is loss, yes, but memory remains. An elegy can only exist if something is remembered, is valued enough to remember.</p>

<p>Change can feel like death, like loss. And I think it&rsquo;s obvious that western culture, especially after centuries of colonization and globalization, is changing. But all things end; this is the way of the world. We may mourn the end, elegize the great monuments of the past. But someday we too will be mourned and elegized by those who come after us.</p>

<p>This knowledge can free us from the need to preserve, from the need to prevent change. And as the seasons shift, let us take a moment to contemplate the transience of the world.</p>
