<p>Welcome to part 2 of my series on the middle ages and why they matter!  As Christians who oppose white supremacy we should take seriously the attempt by white supremacists to frame the middle ages as a racially homogenous (white) Christian utopia. Imagining the past in this way allows white supremacists to believe that western culture (or, more precisely, white culture) is under siege by (take your pick) multiculturalism, feminism, Islam, or political correctness. I introduced this idea in <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-02-2017-middle-ages-introduction">part 1</a>; in part 3 I will look more closely at the claim that Europe was racially homogenous, and in part 4 I will turn to the Crusades.</p>

<p>For part 2, I&rsquo;m starting with the characterization of the medieval period in Europe (roughly 500 - 1500 CE) as the &ldquo;dark ages.&rdquo; This misconception about the middle ages allows us to ignore it. We&rsquo;re predisposed to believe that medieval people were ignorant and racist, so even if we reject the <em>purpose</em> of the white supremacist argument (to elevate whiteness), popular understandings of the middle ages give us no reason to dispute the <em>data</em> behind the claims.</p>

<p>I want to make a case for disputing the data, so we can not only reject the conclusions of white supremacy but also its facts. So we&rsquo;re starting with the idea that the middle ages were the Dark Ages. I cringe just typing the phrase, but you know the narrative: Rome was awesome and cultured (or, at least, powerful). Then stinking, uncivilized barbarians invaded and destroyed. The End. Dark ages for a millennium until the scholars of the Italian Renaissance rediscovered truth and beauty and science and all that. (And, bonus for Protestants, the Reformers simultaneously &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; Christianity.)</p>

<p>This narrative crops up everywhere, even amongst the most educated people. For example, an otherwise solid book published in 2017 (I reviewed it <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/review/book-review-gender-roles-and-people-god">here</a>), says this about the middle ages:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rome&rsquo;s days were numbered, and by the end of the fifth century, the Ostrogothic Kingdom rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire. The thousand-year "Dark Ages&rdquo; had begun, so called because historians have few records from that long period in which much of the earlier culture was lost. In its heyday, the Roman Empire had provided widespread literacy, law, historical records, and an international language of science and literature. But invading barbaric tribes had no interest in preserving much of Roman culture.&ldquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>This nonsense was written by a scholar with advanced degrees and passed through the editing process at a reputable publisher, showing how deeply ingrained this narrative is.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to break this quote down and address three specific misconceptions that undergird the idea of the &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo;: first, that Rome experienced some sort of dramatic fall; second, that Roman (and thus western) culture was lost; and third, that we have few records (historical or otherwise) from this period.</p>

<p>First, the fall of Rome. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that Rome fell to invading barbarian tribes.</p>

<p>But the reality is not anywhere near so simple, even though it is a fact that from 476 CE onward (with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I">brief exception</a>), the western portion of the Roman empire was no longer ruled by people who were ethnically Roman. That &ldquo;ethnically Roman&rdquo; is key, as is the division between eastern and western halves of the empire.</p>

<p>In 293 CE, the emperor Diocletian instituted a tetrarchy, a system of four rulers in the Roman empire. Although his tetrarchy didn&rsquo;t last for long, this system recognized the deep-seated cultural, linguistic and economic divisions between the eastern and western halves of the empire, and a two-emperor system became the new normal. Two hundred years later, Gothic leaders sought to rule in the west, but not the east; and the eastern Roman Empire continued to thrive — as what we call the Byzantine Empire — until 1455.</p>

<p>The Gothic rulers of Rome came, of course, from Germanic tribes, but by the time they ruled Rome in the fifth century they were quite Romanized. They were Christians, they used Latin, they served in Rome&rsquo;s armies as soldiers and generals, they held titles bestowed by the eastern emperor and the Roman Senate. This Romanization of some Gothic tribes began in the fourth century, when several Germanic tribes had been given land and partially incorporated into the Roman Empire in order to defend the empire against other tribes.</p>

<p>Rome, however, treated these tribes (called federated tribes) very poorly, giving them land that couldn&rsquo;t be farmed and withholding promised rights. This understandably angered many Germanic leaders — but they also understood that the Roman army was an excellent way to advance in power and influence. Alaric, the Visigoth who sacked Rome in 410, was a Roman general. Odoacer, the Ostrogoth who took control of the city of Rome in 476 (the date traditionally assigned to the Fall of Rome), was also a Roman soldier who enjoyed the support of the Roman senate and who, in theory at least, placed himself under the authority of the emperor in the east.</p>

<p>But by the time that these Gothic rulers took control of the western part of the empire, Roman control in western Europe had already diminished significantly. Roman armies had conquered large swaths of Europe, building roads and aqueducts and towns for soldiers and bureaucrats, but the expense of maintaining the infrastructure of empire far outweighed the income that came from these western territories. From the mid-third century on, Rome had struggled to maintain the poorer western half of the empire as its center of power shifted eastward. So the Gothic kings styled themselves as Romans in many ways, but their power, like the power of the Roman rulers they replaced, certainly never equalled the power of the emperors during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana"><em>Pax Romana</em></a> (which ended in the late second century).</p>

<p>Additionally, while many Gothic tribes were Romanized, their rulers tended to think in terms of kin groups rather than empires. Thus the power of the Roman rulers gradually diminished to the Italian peninsula itself while other Germanic groups — some Romanized, some not — ruled in various parts of Europe in the early middle ages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve very briefly sketched complex history, but it should be clear that the reports of Rome&rsquo;s death are greatly exaggerated. The Roman empire in the west gradually diminished for economic and political reasons for at least a century before the event we call the fall of Rome in 476 CE. Moreover, the Gothic rulers who took over the western part of the empire were Romanized, as their interest in gaining the support of the Roman Senate and the blessings of the eastern emperor shows. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that things stayed the same; the western empire slowly dissolved as a political entity. But the barbarian hordes narrative certainly doesn&rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a long time on this first point about the fall of Rome because it&rsquo;s necessary for the second point: that Roman culture did not disappear. I&rsquo;ll turn to my other two points, that Roman culture continued and that the middle ages are a rich source of history and culture, on Friday.</p>
