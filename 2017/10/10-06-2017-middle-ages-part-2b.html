<p>We&rsquo;re focusing this week on the idea of the middle ages as &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; because this common narrative, although lacking historical support, makes us inclined to believe that the middle ages were a period of ignorance, barbarism, superstition and bigotry. So when white supremacists use the middle ages to support their claims that western culture is white (and, often, Christian), popular ideas of the middle ages do nothing to combat this view. I&rsquo;ll turn next week to the specific arguments about cultural homogeneity and the crusades, but this week I am laying a foundation for understanding the middle ages as culturally vibrant and crucial in the development of western culture — but a western culture that does not inevitably support white supremacy.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">Wednesday,</a> I sketched out my first objection to the &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; narrative, namely that Rome fell to uncivilized barbarians and everything was basically awful until the Renaissance, when light returned to Europe. Today I look at the other two aspects of the dark ages narrative, that Roman culture disappeared and that the middle ages produced little to nothing of value for western culture.</p>

<p>Although the continuation of Roman culture isn&rsquo;t obvious because of the popular narrative, it really should be obvious. Christianity, the official religion of Rome from the late fourth century onward, continued to be the dominant religion as the various people groups in Europe converted (some more and some less voluntarily) to Christianity. Latin continued to be spoken, although without the standardizing influence of imperial structures it gradually diverged into what we call romance languages — French, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, etc. But as the vernacular (commonly spoken) dialects diverged, Latin remained the standard language of communication across Europe for both the Church and scholarship more broadly.</p>

<p>Roman authors were preserved and studied; educated people from the early to the late middle ages would have been familiar with Ovid, Virgil, Cicero, and a whole host of Roman writers — not to mention the Latin church fathers like Jerome and Augustine.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to discount cultural change, or the impact of the power shifts as the Roman empire disintegrated. The period from the late fifth century through the eighth centuries was marked by invasions and shifting political alliances accompanied by the deterioration of Roman infrastructure (primarily roads and trade routes). The meant less trade and economic prosperity, and as the influence of Rome decreased Germanic customs and laws became more prominent (we can still see their influence in English and American law, in things like juries).</p>

<p>But even as they were aware of their Germanic heritage, most rulers in medieval Europe admired Rome and viewed it as also part of their heritage. Just one example will make my point: the emperor Charlemagne. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 800 CE. The joke goes that the political entity called the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire — and there&rsquo;s some truth in that. But Charlemagne aspired to rule in the style of Rome, and he reopened trade routes, communicated with the Byzantine emperor, and sponsored schools and scholars in what researchers today call the Carolingian renaissance. It&rsquo;s easy to see from our vantage point the differences between Charlemagne&rsquo;s kingdom and the Roman empire. But his desire to emulate the Roman emperors of old should tell us that Rome continued to have an effect on medieval culture.</p>

<p>So why the idea that culture was lost? First, there&rsquo;s that barbarian narrative, promoted by Roman writers during the empire and by historians of Rome since the Italian renaissance. Barbarians are the opposite of cultured — in fact, they smash culture. But this ignores reality, as I discuss above, and ignores the fact that these &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; also had a culture that may have been different from Roman culture but was not inferior. And as with other cultural absorptions before this (as when the Romans emulated Greek culture), western culture became a blend of Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian, and Germanic cultures.</p>

<p>But the grain of truth in the &ldquo;lost culture&rdquo; is the loss of Greek in the medieval west. Some scholars in the middle ages almost certainly learned Greek (<a href="%20https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/">Peter Abelard</a> and possible even <a href="%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lo%C3%AFse">Heloise</a> are examples), but they were a distinct minority. Because very few works by prominent Greek thinkers had been translated into Latin, with the exception of Plato, much Greek philosophy and literature vanished from western Europe until the twelfth century renaissance, when the works of Aristotle were translated into Latin (via Arabic scholarship) and the medieval academic world was transformed.</p>

<p>The scholars of the Italian renaissance, beginning in the fourteenth century, rediscovered more and more Greek texts and began to actually learn Greek, unlike most university scholars of the twelfth century. This does, once again, change the academy with new ideas; but it&rsquo;s a vast overstatement to imagine that this is a rediscovery of western culture. It&rsquo;s a rediscovery of some aspects of Greek culture and a shift in how those sources are studied — even if the Italian humanists paint themselves in a far more radical light.</p>

<p>Finally — and I imagine that I&rsquo;ve partially made this point already — the middle ages were a culturally rich period. The idea that historians have few records would be laughable it it weren&rsquo;t so common. True, there are certain periods and places where historical records are fragmentary; invasions in the fifth through seventh centuries by Germanic tribes and, later, Arabic groups disrupt or destroy records, as do the ninth and tenth century invasions by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyar_tribes">Magyars</a> and Vikings. And obviously, cultural productions (art, literature, scholarship) are difficult during periods when people are focused on simple survival.</p>

<p>But the cultural accomplishments of the middle ages are substantial. Medieval buildings still dot the European landscape. Medieval authors, like Chaucer and Dante, shaped the course of western literature by writing in vernacular languages rather than Latin. Medieval artists and artisans pioneered stained glass and built soaring cathedrals that we still admire. Many of the great universities of Europe — Oxford, Paris, Bologna — were all established in the high middle ages. Scholasticism grappled with how to integrate theology and philosophy, faith and reason, in ways that still shape our approaches to those topics. <a href="http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/staley-book-of-margery-kempe-introduction">Margery Kempe</a>, in England, wrote what many consider the first autobiography, while French and English writers pioneered the prose narratives that became the modern novel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system#History">Double entry bookkeeping</a> was invented in medieval Italy while Italian city-states like Florence embraced republican forms of government. The nation-state itself as a political entity emerged in the late middle ages.</p>

<p>I could go on, but you get the picture.</p>

<p>Was there oppression and injustice in medieval Europe? Certainly. There were also odd notions about bathing, and medical care — while based on Greek and Roman ideas — was not particularly effective.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> As in most of the ancient world, illiterate peasants<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> made up the vast majority of the population while a small cadre of nobles held the wealth and power.</p>

<p>But to dismiss the middle ages as the dark ages, a time of ignorance and barbarity, is to ignore a vast swath of time and its equally vast influence on the development of western culture.</p>

<p>If we can&rsquo;t simply dismiss the middle ages as ignorant and backwards, then we also can&rsquo;t abandon it to those who would twist history to support white supremacy. And in parts three and four of this series, I will turn to two main arguments for white supremacy in the middle ages and examine why they are wrong.</p>

<p>Literacy rates are notoriously difficult to measure. If literacy meant knowledge of Latin — how medieval people would have measured literacy — only a small portion of the population was literate.
