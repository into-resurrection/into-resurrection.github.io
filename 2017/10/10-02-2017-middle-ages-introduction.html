<p>Last week, I wrote about how the culture war is concerned, at least in part, with defending and defining western culture. The &ldquo;defining&rdquo; piece is crucial: western culture has been around for at least 2500 years, and that&rsquo;s if we only start with the Greeks (the Golden Age of Athens began in roughly 480 BCE). Western culture has also spread geographically from a small section of the Mediterranean (again, if we discount the earlier Fertile Crescent cultures) to dominate two continents and influence most of the rest of the globe.</p>

<p>Obviously, something that old and that spread out contains multitudes.</p>

<p>In order to make this history more manageable, most people intentionally or not focus on western history post-Renaissance or post-Enlightenment. (That is, western history after 1500 or 1700 CE.) Scholars designate this the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; period, and this is an age of rationalism, science and technology, individualism, capitalism, colonialism, and democracy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also distressingly common for people — laypeople and scholars alike — to accept the assertions of Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers that they emerged from a previous period of darkness and chaos. &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; means rebirth; &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; emphasizes the light (of reason) triumphing over darkness.</p>

<p>These are inspiring narratives, no doubt, and they fit neatly into our own current sense of being the best, the most advanced, the most intelligent society in the history of earth. But in addition to a wee bit of hubris, these claims actually obscure a far richer and more complex understanding of western culture.</p>

<p>So, why does this matter? Why should a modern-day Christian living in the western world care about understanding the past?</p>

<p>There are a lot of possible answers to that question. If we don&rsquo;t understand the past, we are doomed to repeat it. Or, understanding the past makes us better, well-rounded people. Or, understanding the past gives us new perspectives on the problems of modern life.</p>

<p>All of these are true, at least in part (although I have Things To Say about the &ldquo;doomed to repeat the past&rdquo; bit). But there&rsquo;s a more pressing reason to understand the pre-Enlightenment, pre-Renaissance past these days, and that&rsquo;s thanks to the growing visibility of white supremacy.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2017/08/teaching-medieval-studies-in-time-of.html?m=1">many</a> <a href="https://psmag.com/education/nazis-love-taylor-swift-and-also-the-crusades">medievalists</a> (scholars of the middle ages) have recently pointed out, those of us with expertise in the field need to do a better job of explaining how the medieval past does not support white supremacy. If we as Christians also want to reject white supremacy, it&rsquo;s worth understanding and resisting how this movement twists medieval history.</p>

<p>And as Christians, this task is <em>especially</em> important because the way that white supremacists frame the middle ages is often as an era of the church militant and triumphant: it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that pictures of the rally in Charlottesville this August show men with medieval shields and crusader crosses, often paired with the Latin phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_vult"><em>deus vult</em></a> — a crusading slogan.</p>

<p>If we care about racism, history, or Christianity, we should care about understanding the medieval past and the role of the church in that past.</p>

<p>(Note: for simplicity, I will use &ldquo;middle ages&rdquo; and &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; to refer to the European middle ages. But the world didn&rsquo;t contract to Europe in this period: a variety of cultures flourished in the far east, the middle east, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and the Americas — and Europe had contact with many of them. Focusing only on Europe is, of course, one way in which the primacy of western culture is reinforced. But my own expertise is in the European middle ages, and this is the specific era that is being twisted to support white nationalism.)</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I will examine a couple of specific misconceptions about the middle ages that fuel the myths of white supremacy:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The middle ages were the Dark Ages and Everything was Awful All. The. Time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Europe was racially homogenous.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The crusades were about defending Europe from Islam.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>I hope that, through the next several posts, I can show that the history and culture of the middle ages in Europe cannot be used a support for white supremacy. I want to replace the myth of racial, cultural and religious homogeneity with a more complex picture of medieval history.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to be completely honest here: I love the middle ages. I find them fascinating on so many levels: the theological debates, the literary innovations, the emergence of the nation-state, the art, the manuscripts. Basically everything. I&rsquo;ve also spent the last fifteen or so years of my life studying this period and helping my students to understand it.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a little passionate.</p>

<p>Like all other time periods (and maybe more so, since the medieval period spans roughly a thousand years), there are good and bad parts. And I&rsquo;m certainly not interested in the slightest in giving up my voting rights, sweat-wicking fabrics, antibiotics or Netflix. All of which to say: I&rsquo;m not interested in glorifying chivalry or monarchy, or sugar-coating the really sucky aspects of living in the middle ages.</p>

<p>But this is also part of our history, and as we think about what it might mean to move beyond modernism, understanding the pre-modern past can be instructive. And now, more than ever, we must assert and affirm that western culture does not inevitably lead to white supremacy (although it has produced plenty of white supremacists).</p>

<p>Come with me over the next two weeks to learn a little more about the strange and wonderful world of the middle ages as we reclaim the history of Europe.</p></div>
