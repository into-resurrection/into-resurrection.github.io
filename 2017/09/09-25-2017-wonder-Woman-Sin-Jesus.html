<blockquote><p><em>The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.</em>
<em>— Alexander Solzhenitsyn</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Fair warning: here be spoilers</em></p>

<p>Watching <em>Wonder Woman</em> on video last week, for a second time, I was struck by the way the storyline handles the idea of sin and evil in the world. I was also struck by how, even as she grapples with the evil within humanity, Diana chooses to love humanity in a way that reflects Christ.</p>

<p>Of course, having a superhero be a Christ-figure is so common as to be a cliché. Many male superheroes, in at least some of their storylines, fit this trope: Superman (obvs), Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man in <em>The Avengers</em>. Even the B-cast characters can be Christ-figures, like Agent Phil Coulson (<em>The Avengers</em>, <em>Agents of Shield</em>). These characters all sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, and — spoiler alert — none of them stay dead after their sacrifice (if they even die at all).</p>

<p>But Diana isn’t this sort of Christ-figure. She does leave her paradise of a home, and she certainly puts herself in danger for others — but at least in this summer’s film, she does not sacrifice herself for the sake of others. Instead, she chooses to live with humanity, loving them despite their flaws.</p>

<p>As the film sets up this choice, we see that at first Diana’s decision to help humanity is easy. She has been taught that Zeus created humans in his own image; as her mother tells her, mankind is “fair and good, strong and passionate.” But they become corrupted by Ares, god of war, envious of his father’s creation. Despite the intervention of the Amazons, humans remained corrupted, and eventually a war broke out between Ares and the other gods.</p>

<p>When Diana learns that World War I is raging — the Great War, the War to End All Wars — she is convinced that Ares is responsible. She leaves Themyscira, convinced that she can end the war by killing Ares. But what she discovers is more complicated. Ares is involved, yes (this is, after all, a superhero movie). But humans are not simply innocents, corrupted by another. They are fully complicit in the evil that is war.</p>

<p>The film shows the evil of humanity repeatedly. The unwillingness of leaders to seek peace. The stream of wounded humanity as Steve and Diana cross into Europe. The broken spirit of Charlie. The devastation of no man’s land, reflected in bodies, villages and landscapes. The acknowledgment that even though the Americans are fighting against oppression in this war, they conquered and oppressed native populations.</p>

<p>But Diana does not truly face this evil until, when she thinks she has killed Ares, she is shocked that the soldiers continue their destructive work, oblivious to her fight with General Ludendorff. She is experiencing what Ares later confirms: he may give some well-placed nudges towards evil, but humans are capable of great evil on their own.</p>

<p>This realization devastates Diana. Her view of humanity — “fair and good,” in the words of her mother’s bedtime story — is shattered.</p>

<p>But even as she turns to leave, newly aware of the truth in her mother’s parting words that humanity does not deserve her, she sees her companions willing to sacrifice themselves in order to save others. She sees Steve Trevor’s ultimate act of bravery and selflessness.</p>

<p>Diana faces the truth of the Solzhenitsyn quote above: humanity is both evil and good. And rather than abandon humanity in disdain of the evil, she chooses to stay out of love for the good.</p>

<p>Now, the analogy to Christ isn’t perfect. Unlike Diana, Jesus was fully aware of humanity’s sinfulness when he became incarnate. But like Christ, Diana also lives amongst humanity, serving and saving, because of her love for them. She leaves her home on Paradise Island and her place as the daughter of the queen because she believes that people, regardless of their evil nature, deserve a hero, deserve a savior.</p>

<p>This isn’t a side of the Christ-trope that we often see, at least in blockbuster films. When the hero dies, or nearly dies, for others, the focus typically remains on the hero. Sure, we get shots of grateful New Yorkers, but the hero’s bravery is the central point. Diana’s choice isn’t so much bravery as commitment, and the focus shifts from her actions to her reasons for the action, to her love for undeserving humanity.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Woman</em> tells Diana’s origin story. We see this as she learns who she is (the god-killer) and as she embraces her power in the fabulous no-man’s land scene. But the story behind the story is signaled by the photograph she receives as the film begins: the story of how she came to love humanity, the tale of why she chose to stay.</p>

<p>This origin story reminds us of the evil of humanity, of our sin nature. But it also reminds us of the lavish love of Christ, who lived among us despite the evil within each us and who never tells us that we don’t deserve him.</p>
