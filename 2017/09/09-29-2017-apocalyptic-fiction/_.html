<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of science fiction and fantasy — have been since my dad started reading me <em>The Hobbit</em> when I was six or seven. Early exposure to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis likely predisposed me to medieval studies and set up a lifelong skepticism of realistic fiction.</p>

<p>While I enjoy SF/F of all types, I&rsquo;m always particularly intrigued by how writers integrate faith into their worlds. Charlie Stross&rsquo;s series <em>The Laundry Files</em> doesn&rsquo;t portray faith (especially of the American evangelical variety) particularly positively. But the series focuses on a coming apocalypse in which Lovecraftian horrors from beyond our universe will crash into our reality and devour us all, and I find this vision of the coming apocalypse both horrifying and compelling — the mark of enjoyable fiction.</p>

<p>I confess that apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction always piques my interest. Maybe it comes of having been raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism">dispensationalist</a> — you can take the girl out of the pre-trib rapture, but you can&rsquo;t take the four horsemen of the apocalypse out of the girl (as they say).</p>

<p>Stross&rsquo;s novels mostly follow Bob Howard, programmer and British civil servant, as he attempts to avert apocalyptic events. The series was described to me as James Bond meets Cthulhu, but only if James Bond is a nerd who constantly ends up way over his head and who actually, like, respects women (although he still has cool gadgets). Oh, and Bob works for a shadowy British agency dedicated to helping humanity survive <strong><em>Code Nightmare Green</em></strong>, a rapidly approaching time when our reality will coincide with the reality of those Lovecraftian horrors who will most likely find humanity an appetizing snack.</p>

<p>Stross does a fantastic job of capturing the pure horror of the vastly powerful non-human entities that are just waiting for a chance to come to earth and consume it. One such entity is simply called the Sleeper: this being is currently trapped in an a pyramid on a dead planet guarded by zombie Russian soldiers, in a bizarre scene custom-designed to produce nightmares.</p>

<p>In <em>The Apocalypse Codex</em>, the fourth book in the series, an American religious group led by the charismatic Ray Schiller seeks to wake the Sleeper. It seems that Schiller truly believes that the Sleeper is Christ and that he, by infecting people with parasitic hosts, is bringing about the Second Coming. Stross does present this cult as a perversion of more normal manifestations of Christianity (i.e., he doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the eucharist actually allows mind-controlling parasites into the bodies of partakers). But by linking the coming Lovecraftian horrors to apocalyptic Christian beliefs, Stross raises an interesting question about the nature of the apocalypse.</p>

<p>As Christians, we typically view the Second Coming of Christ (with or without a rapture or a millennial kingdom) as a good thing, although there may be a few unpleasant moments with beasts and Babylonian women of questionable morals. As N.T. Wright has noted in <em>Surprised by Hope</em>, Christians are often muddled about what life after death or the return of Christ means — but we do tend to agree that it will ultimately be a good thing for at least some of humanity (typically including us, of course).</p>

<p><figure class="float-right">

<p></figure></p>

<p>But think about this from another point of view: the second coming is <em>apocalyptic</em>. Even if we believe, with Wright, that Christ is returning not to annihilate but to to make new, the world will be completely changed. We believe that this change will be for the better, bringing peace and justice and God&rsquo;s good kingdom come on earth. Yet we&rsquo;re still imagining an alien entity coming down and remaking the entire world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that we need to start imagining God as one of Lovecraft&rsquo;s Great Old Ones, inimical to humanity. But we tend to imagine that God&rsquo;s kingdom will conform to our own ideas of happiness and goodness, whether that&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_House_(song)">mansions and football</a>, angels with harps on clouds, or peace on earth and the total eradication of mosquitoes (not just me, right?).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the return of Christ, the establishment of his kingdom on earth, will be a cataclysmic event that upturns the entire order of the created world. This is cause for rejoicing, as all that is wrong is made right again. But it&rsquo;s also a transformation beyond our wildest imaginings. As C.S. Lewis reminds us, our God is good, but he is not safe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to avoid the apocalypse as envisioned by Stross, even if I enjoy stories about British agents battling unspeakable horrors from beyond our universe. But it&rsquo;s worth remembering, now and again, that the transformation we await as Christians will be bigger than we can possibly understand.</p></div>
