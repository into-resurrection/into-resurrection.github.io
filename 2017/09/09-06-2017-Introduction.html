    <div class="body"><p>Living into resurrection: as Christians, we are called to put off the old sinful ways and live into the new life of the resurrection. This life is breaking into the world through Christ and the church, but will not fully arrive until the return of Christ. Living into resurrection is a struggle, a learning process, a series of failures — but what we are called to do.</p>

<p>While all Christians are called to live into resurrection, the idea behind this blog is to explore what this means for those of us who are discontent with evangelicalism. We’re sure about Jesus, but weary of culture wars; we’re politically engaged, but unwilling to equate conservatism with faithful Christian witness; we’re thinking about sin, but on structural as well as personal levels.</p>

<p>I’m right in this journey, so this isn’t the place to find answers. But I believe that asking the right questions is often more important than finding the right answers, so I envision this as a place for working through the questions that arise as I work towards living out my faith.</p>

<p>As is probably clear already, I’m particularly interested in orthopraxy, in putting faith into action. Actions spring from beliefs, so orthodoxy is also important — but I will be thinking through the cycle in which our beliefs influence our actions, which then in turn shape our beliefs. To put it a little differently, I’m interested in how authority (beliefs) and experience (actions) interact and inform one another.</p>

<p>The divide between authority and experience, or reason and emotion, pervades western culture — with authority and reason most often given preeminence over experience and emotion. But as an embodied human being with a rational mind, I can’t pretend that my experiences and actions matter less than my reason or are wholly subordinate to authority and logic.</p>

<p>The bodily resurrection of Christ shows the redemption of our whole selves: bodies as well as souls, emotions as well as reason. So as we live into the resurrection, it’s not enough to simply have a set of right beliefs, the right mental framework. That mental framework must affect our actions and must in turn respond to and benefit from our own embodied experience.</p>

<p>That’s all very theoretical. But practically, as we live into resurrection, what does it mean to put off sin? What does it mean to act justly, to love mercy? How do we love others as ourselves, let alone love our enemies? American society at this particular moment calls out for answers. Racial injustice, sexism and misogyny, and economic oppression demand an embodied theology, demand beliefs that produce action.</p>

<p>I’m still working on that myself. Growing up in the evangelical church, faith seemed to be mostly about believing the right things and living a morally good life. Church members prayed for each other, brought meals to the ill and donated to foreign missions, but personal spiritual growth always seemed to be the dominant goal. Sin was mainly personal, and the resurrection meant that we get to go to heaven when we die.</p>

<p>At a certain point, though, I began to rethink this approach to Christianity (largely thanks to the work of N.T. Wright). If sin is bigger than just me, and resurrection is bigger than just me — Christianity must also be much bigger than just me. Over the last decade, I have been in the process of reframing my Christianity as participating in God’s resurrection work in the world, a work that goes far beyond me as an individual.</p>

<p>As part of this journey, I have become a feminist. I’m still learning about issues of race in America, but I am committed to the work of racial justice. I affirm the dignity and worth of those who identify as LGBTQ. I mourn the economic forces that keep many in poverty. I am trying to learn what it means to be a Christian and to love my neighbor, to act justly, to seek mercy.</p>

<p>If this is also your journey — whatever your starting point — I hope that we can walk together for a while as we strive to live into resurrection.</p></div>
