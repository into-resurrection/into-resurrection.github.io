<p>I ended <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-25-2017-womens-value">Wednesday&rsquo;s post</a> with the paradox at the heart of complementarian theology: that God views women as equal to men, but nevertheless has placed them in a position of permanent subordination to men. Complementarians like Piper don&rsquo;t seem to see the problems in this paradox, however; they insist that being inferior in <em>position</em> is not the same things as being inferior by <em>nature</em>, or ontologically.</p>

<p>Of course, a woman&rsquo;s nature is what places her in the position of inferiority to being with, leaving the easy inference that our nature is indeed inferior. Either that, or God is arbitrary: for no reason other than a lack of male genitalia, we women are barred from leading and teaching men, even if we have the gifts and talents to do so.</p>

<p>In short, despite Piper&rsquo;s insistence that God values women as much as men, complementarian theology undercuts this equality. And as I discussed on Wednesday, this subordination of women is exacerbated because men, in this theology, retain all the power. They lead in churches and in families, and are given the power of the final decision. They have both positional authority as husbands and pastors and real power over the members of their households or churches. Women are to affirm this leadership and partner with it, but not take on these roles themselves.</p>

<p>Now, I want to be careful here: many Christians affirm this theological position without adhering to it at all times. I know marriages in which the spouses intellectually affirm male headship, but practically function as egalitarians, sharing decisions, responsibilities, and power. I have been part of a church in which women couldn&rsquo;t be the head pastor, and yet they served, led and taught at every other level of the church. Ideologies have power and can be damaging even when not fully implemented, but I want to be clear that many, and probably most, Christian men don&rsquo;t intentionally abuse the position this reading of scripture gives them.</p>

<p>However, any theology that permanently places women in subordinate positions on the basis of their biological sex alone has the potential to be harmful.</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to maintain an intellectual distinction between inferiority of position and inferiority of nature, especially when that inferior position comes directly from nature. Thus women are viewed as inferior to men: physically weaker, emotionally less stable, analytically less capable.</p>

<p>In this attitude, the church is no different from the surrounding culture. The same perceptions keep women out of pulpits and C-suites, teaching roles and senate seats, finance committees and tech companies. And both complementarians and secular people fall back on the same excuse, that women aren&rsquo;t inferior — just different. But when &ldquo;different&rdquo; overwhelmingly means &ldquo;not as good as&rdquo; and &ldquo;subordinate,&rdquo; women are left not only feeling but also being treated as less valuable than men.</p>

<p>This attitude harms both individual women and the church as a body. Relying on stereotypes of women, and particularly those stereotypes that make them inferior to men, means that the church misses out on many gifts and talents. The college professor may be shunted to children&rsquo;s Sunday school rather than encouraged to teach adults. The brilliant accountant may be pushed to lead the bake sale rather than the finance team. The non-profit director may be asked to volunteer in the nursery rather than on the leadership team.</p>

<p>Enshrining stereotypes as God&rsquo;s plan, especially when these stereotypes are combined with prohibitions on women leading and teaching men, means that talent and passion can get overlooked, . And women do notice: they may continue to attend and serve, or they may leave, but they know that their gifts have been judged as not good enough for the church because of their gender. So individuals have been harmed, and the church body has also been harmed.</p>

<p>Second, and more seriously, viewing women as inferior and subordinate makes abuse more likely and makes male church leaders less likely to take that abuse seriously. As I said above, most complementarian men don&rsquo;t abuse their power. But I have heard and read story after story of women told to stay in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-18/domestic-violence-church-submit-to-husbands/8652028">abusive marriages</a>, of women <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/02/01/the-strange-case-of-the-pastor-released-from-iran-and-his-wifes-abuse-allegations/?utm_term=.221ac7416aeb">not believed</a> when they come forward with reports of assault, of women silenced and <a href="http://thewartburgwatch.com/2017/09/23/janes-traumatic-rape-and-subsequent-mistreatment-by-officials-at-the-masters-college-now-university/">shamed</a>. I have stories from my time as a professor at a Christian college that I can&rsquo;t share but that still make me rage.</p>

<p>If men are more important than women, their word is more trustworthy and their reputation is more valuable. This leaves women alone, vulnerable, hurting, doubting their own experiences and making light of their own pain. Complementarian theology doesn&rsquo;t condone abuse, but it creates the environment in which abuse can happen with few consequences for the abuser.</p>

<p>I believe that complementarians misread several key passages from scripture, but I want to end today&rsquo;s post by returning to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 5</a>, one of the key passages on which John Piper bases his assertion that men are to lead. This passage begins in verse 21, with the command for Christians to submit to one another, before moving into marriage specifically. Wives are told to submit to their husbands in verse 22, and in verse 25 husbands are told to love their wives as Christ loved the church &ldquo;and gave himself up for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the context of mutual submission (verse 21), this verse implies something rather different from top-down leadership. The phrasing of giving oneself up for another obviously refers to Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross, but it also evokes another passage: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 2</a>. In this passage, Paul describes how Christ &ldquo;made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness&rdquo; (v. 7).</p>

<p>Christ is, by nature and position, superior to the church — he is God, and the church is not. And yet he becomes human because of his love for his people. Similarly, in first-century Rome husbands were considered superior to their wives both legally and by nature. Paul asks husbands in Ephesians 5 to sacrifice their superiority as Christ sacrificed his for the church; he encourages them to love their wives as they love themselves — as equals to themselves.</p>

<p>The analogy with Christ breaks down here, of course, because Paul suggests that men and women are actually equal in the eyes of God. But because men are not superior by nature, they are to imitate Christ and lay down their superior position in mutual submission to their wives. Today, unlike in Paul&rsquo;s Rome, American men have not held legal superiority in their marriages for several decades. And yet complementarian theology tells husbands to hold on to their superior position, contrary to Paul and America&rsquo;s legal system.</p>

<p>As I read this Ephesians passage, Paul assumes the equal standing of men and women in the eyes of God, and because of this he directs men to lay down their positional superiority. That is, men are not to be superior to women in position because they are not superior by nature, which means that women ought to be treated as equals rather than relegated to inferior positions. Ephesians 5 talks about marriage specifically, not church leadership. But it establishes that men and women are equal in value while asking men to lay down the superiority granted them by a patriarchal culture.</p>

<p>However, complementarianism argues that men have the superior position, even if not the superior nature. Because this distinction is difficult to maintain, especially in face of pervasive cultural misogyny, women are treated as inferiors and this causes harm to women and the church on a variety of levels. In response, the church needs to actively cultivate an environment in which women are taken seriously and treated as full human beings equal to men both by nature and in the positions they can occupy. Abuse will never be fully eradicated, but a theology that makes women inferior cannot address the conditions in which abuse flourishes.</p></div>

<p>When I wrote about the #MeToo movement <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-18-2017-me-too">last week</a>, I looked at attitudes towards women in America broadly. But the church is often no better than the surrounding culture at valuing women as human beings, and this tendency is exacerbated by complementarian theologies that affirm male headship and male leadership.</p>

<p>I found a perfect example of this tendency earlier this year in an episode of &ldquo;Ask Pastor John,&rdquo; John Piper&rsquo;s podcast in which he addresses theological questions. In <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/are-men-superior-to-women">this episode</a>, Piper attempts to reassure a woman who finds that complementarian theology intensifies her feelings of inferiority to the men around her. Here is her question in full:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Hello Pastor John, my name is Jennifer and I live on Long Island. I have a question about complementarianism. It is something I have struggled with for a long time, and it is something I need to have worked out before even considering a relationship or marriage in the future. I know the Bible clearly states that men and women are equal in their standing before God as far as salvation. But in other areas of life I still struggle with feelings of inferiority, because of certain comparisons used in the Bible. For example, regarding submission, the Bible says that the servant is not greater than his master, and wives are called to submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ. However, servants are not equal to their masters, and the church is not equal in worth to Christ. In almost every area of life, those in positions of authority are considered more valuable than those under that authority. Just like the President is more valued than the secret service men, and in businesses, managers are more valued than the workers under them, and throughout history women have always been treated as less valuable than men. In light of these things, I greatly struggle with feeling inferior in worth to men. Is there something that you might be able to see that I am missing, as I read through Scripture? Thank you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In his response, Piper rightfully affirms the equal standing of men and women before God. But from there, his answer highlights the ways in which complementarian theology cannot address Jennifer’s concerns and instead reinforces the inferior position of women, largely because Piper refuses to acknowledge the way we humans perceive and value leaders and followers.</p>

<p>First, Piper begins with the question of whether men and women are truly equal. He points out the biological differences between men and women: men tend to be larger and stronger, while only women are capable of bearing children. After an unfounded dig at the scientific community for allegedly obscuring other differences between genders, Piper concludes that the sum total of the “superiorities and inferiorities” of men and women is equal.</p>

<p>On one level, despite sniping at studies of gender differences (which not only exist but permeate pop culture psychologies of men and women), Piper is right. Men and women have different biologies; men&rsquo;s greater testosterone levels give them an undeniable strength advantage, and obviously possessing a uterus is a prerequisite of childbearing. How, and even if, these biological differences affect other differences — in language, analysis, emotion, etc. — is much less clear, but biological differences without a doubt play a large role in our experiences in the world.</p>

<p>On another level, however, Piper&rsquo;s point is so broad as to be almost meaningless. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and no one person is good at all the things — regardless of gender. Imagining each gender with a balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses that ultimately even out seems odd and unnecessary when we could simply say that everyone is different, due to complex mixes of biology and sociology. Regardless of their personal strengths and weaknesses, each person is created in the image of God and valued by God as much as any other human being.</p>

<p>Moreover, imagining a balance sheet for each gender erases the way in which society <em>values</em> these differences, biological or conditioned. We can argue that intuitive thinking is as valuable as rational thinking, or cooperative leadership as valuable as command leadership, but are we under any illusions about which one is valued more in society? And which one is associated with women?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pick on Piper too much in this point, since he is fully affirming the equality of men and women in the eyes of God. But he misses the point that society values men and women differently, and that the church tends to follow suit. We see this clearly in Jennifer&rsquo;s letter: she feels inferior because society has been telling her that she is inferior to men and then, when she turns to the church and the complementarian interpretation of the bible, she does not find a different message.</p>

<p>In short, I agree with Piper&rsquo;s point that God loves men and women equally. But this isn&rsquo;t really Jennifer&rsquo;s problem; she is concerned that the very human and socially embedded institution of the church sees her as inferior, and Piper&rsquo;s response has, up to this point, failed to address that issue.</p>

<p>And he continues to fail to address Jennifer&rsquo;s sense of inferiority in a meaningful way. Piper next turns to the scripture passages that particularly trouble Jennifer, those about servants and masters and about marriage reflecting Christ and the church. In the context of servants and masters, Piper reads these passages as affirming the spiritual equality of servants, thus sidestepping the question of superiority and inferiority. I wish that Piper had made explicit what seems to be his implicit point: the master-servant dynamic is socially constructed and thus cannot reflect the value of a person. But this argument would become problematic for his reading of Ephesians 5, in which male headship is God-ordained rather than a more malleable social construction.</p>

<p>When Piper turns to the Ephesians 5 passage about marriage, he reinforces the socially imposed power structures of Greco-Roman marriages. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>“owing to God’s design in creation, the point of comparison [between Christ and the Church] is that godly, mature manhood and womanhood are of such a nature that they both experience a sense of fitness and suitableness and appropriateness in the roles of manhood as humble leadership and protection and provision and womanhood as gladly affirming that leadership and partnering with a man in the use of her gifts to carry it through — and whether that fitness lies in some overall superiority or inferiority need not be implied in this text about husbands and wives. I don’t think it is implied.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is hardly a resounding affirmation of the equality of men and women. In her question, Jennifer is struggling with the fact that leaders are seen as more important than those who are lead — and with the fact that her female anatomy bars her from leadership roles. Piper reaffirms that men are to be the leaders and then asserts that this doesn&rsquo;t imply superiority. But the problem is that in our society, as in the apostle Paul&rsquo;s, leaders are valued above followers.</p>

<p>In many realms of life, this valuation of leaders doesn&rsquo;t leave followers feeling inferior; most of us have a variety of roles in which we may lead or follow, and those roles are fluid as we progress in careers or take on new responsibilities. But when someone is barred from a leadership position on the basis of some quality beyond their control — like sex or race — it&rsquo;s almost impossible not to see that prohibition as an indication of inferiority.</p>

<p>Following what he says about servants and masters, Piper could have noted that loving one’s wife as Christ loved the church is a distinct subversion of the power dynamic that Paul’s audience would have expected between husbands and wives. Even if a marriage outwardly conformed to first-century Roman norms, telling husbands to lead in mutual submission to their wives (Eph. 5:21) and in imitation of Christ’s self-sacrificing love subverts the power dynamic of leader and follower, or superior and inferior.</p>

<p>But Piper doesn’t say this. He simply affirms that men are to lead and women are to follow, asserting that couples who follow this pattern will find a sense of “fitness” in these roles that, apparently, mirrors the fitness we feel as Christians following Christ. Piper ignores the value we place on leadership and, by extension, leaders. Moreover, Piper isn&rsquo;t merely granting nominal leadership, as Paul may do — that is, the position of leader without the power. He intends for men to have the power in the relationship: the power of the final decision, the power implied in protection and provision. Women are excluded from that power on the basis of their biological sex alone.</p>

<p>Piper thinks that Jennifer can and should believe two things simultaneously: that God sees her as the equal of men, and that God has decreed that she must only follow and support men. He believes that the value gained in the first belief negates any inferiority implied in the second; or, that if Jennifer&rsquo;s sense of inferiority lingers, it should be vanquished by the belief that this arrangement is God&rsquo;s good plan. But his inability to consider either the social value placed on leaders (one held by the church no less than the world) or to consider the implications of the power dynamic means that he cannot assure Jennifer that she isn&rsquo;t actually inferior.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Piper can only answer that God intends for women to be in a position not only judged by society as inferior but also truly lesser in terms of power and influence, while still insisting that this doesn&rsquo;t make women <em>actually</em> inferior to men in the eyes of God. This paradox at the core of complementarian theology leaves women like Jennifer feeling less than men and prevents leaders like Piper from acknowledging the harm caused by their theology. And I will turn to this harm in Friday&rsquo;s post.</p></div>

<p>It comes as a surprise to many that medieval women made substantial contributions to theology. Our popular image of the middle ages emphasizes its darkness and ignorance, which surely (we assume) includes the oppression of women. But medieval women did have avenues of influence in the church, and even the briefest survey of Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s life shows both her political and her theological influence.</p>

<p>Born in 1347, the year the plague swept into Europe, middle-class Catherine grew up to become an important figure in Italian politics and a mystic theologian. Accounts of her life report that she began having mystic visions as a child of 5 or 6, visions that continued throughout her life. But Catherine hardly secluded herself in order to experience these visions; she lived an active life both within her community and beyond it, in the realm of Italian politics.</p>

<p>When Catherine was 16, she refused a marriage her parents had attempted to arrange and instead became a tertiary in the Dominican order. A tertiary in a monastic order lives a life in accordance with the vows of monasticism (poverty, chastity, obedience) but does not actually take those vows. Catherine was probably attracted to living a monastic life without being secluded in a cloister, as she would have been were she a Dominican nun. She did, however, spend the next three years praying and fasting before she reemerged into public life.</p>

<p>From the time she was 19 until her early death at 33 (in 1380), Catherine served her community in a variety of ways. She worked with the poor and the sick, giving away her own food and tending plague victims. In her mid-20s, Catherine began to travel in Italy and to write letters to a variety of important Italians, offering advice and urging peace between warring Italian cities. Nearly 400 of these letters still survive. Even as she became involved in politics, however, her role was primarily that of a spiritual advisor, encouraging repentance and renewal.</p>

<p>As her influence in Italian politics grew, Catherine became involved in the complex politics around the Avignon Papacy. In 1309, long before Catherine&rsquo;s birth, the papacy had relocated from Rome to Avignon, France under pressure from French rulers. This move caused significant distress in the church, and Catherine&rsquo;s voice joined a chorus begging the pope to return to Rome. She herself travelled to Avignon in 1376 and met with Pope Gregory XI, where she urged him to return to Rome. Catherine was not the only influence in his decision, but Gregory XI did indeed return to Rome in 1377 — although much to Catherine&rsquo;s dismay, within a year this move precipitated a schism in the church, with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon.</p>

<p>In the brief period between the return of Gregory XI and the schism, Catherine produced her treatise, <em>The Dialogue.</em> She seems to have dictated much of it while having visions, but she likely learned to write in order to edit her own text.  Reading and writing were distinct skills in the middle ages, and Catherine seems to have relied on scribes to write while she dictated her letters. But she evidently wanted a greater degree of control over the text of <em>The Dialogue,</em> which points to its importance as a record of her mystical experiences.</p>

<p>Like most medieval mystic theology, <em>The Dialogue</em> both records Catherine&rsquo;s mystical visions and reflects theologically on them. Particularly striking imagery fills the conclusion, as Catherine uses an almost dizzying array of images and metaphors to describe God. In just a few paragraphs, God is the deep sea, a burning fire, the abyss, a craftsman, light, a mirror, and a garment. Through these images, Catherine attempts to describe her understanding of God in a spirit of humble awe at the revelations she has received. Her images pile up, overlap, some harmonious, some discordant — but all point towards the depth of God&rsquo;s love for humanity and the overwhelming but good nature of God.</p>

<p>Catherine died in 1380, physically worn down by years of fasting and deeply disappointed by the emerging schism in the church. Her life was short but full: in her brief 33 years, she meet with rulers and popes, persuading them to restore peace and return the papacy to its rightful home. But above all this, she frequently experienced the direct presence of God. Her <em>Dialogue</em> meditates on these experiences, attempting to explain the magnitude of God&rsquo;s love and the necessity of responding to it, despite our inability to ever reflect God.</p>

<p>Catherine was revered immediately upon her death, and sainted in 1461. And her legacy has continued: in 1970, Catherine was named a Doctor of the Church, an honor given to 36 men and women (currently) who made significant contributions to theology. Also, in 1999, Pope John Paul II named Catherine one of the six patron saints of Europe.</p>

<p>Despite her brief life, Catherine brilliantly exemplifies how we can combine the active and contemplative lives. Her involvement in both charity work close to home and Italian politics reflect her rich direct experiences with God as she strove to bring the peace and love of God to those around her, while urging them to respond to that peace and love with repentance and renewal.</p></div>

<p>By happy coincidence, last week I was reading both Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s <em>Delusions of Gender</em> and Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s essay collection <em>The Givenness of Things</em>, which begins with &ldquo;Humanism.&rdquo; In this essay, Robinson considers the limitations of neuroscience, which she describes as reducing the intricate complexity of the brain to &ldquo;an essentially simple thing.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This reduction, in Robinson&rsquo;s analysis, rejects the notion of the self and ultimately results in a devaluation of humanity.</p>

<p>Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s book is a little less intellectually lofty, but she also takes popular neuroscience to task, specifically for oversimplifying and overstating complex and often unclear results about differences between men and women. Fine&rsquo;s more narrow argument supports Robinson&rsquo;s larger point: when neuroscience is used to support sweeping generalizations about gender differences, both men and women are dehumanized, their potentials and limitations reduced to electrical impulses in their brains.</p>

<p>Fine argues, repeatedly, that a focus on the brain alone erases the many social factors that lead men and women to behave and respond differently — in other words, neuroscientists tend to study brains as isolated rather than embedded in complex social networks. Reading Fine in conjunction with Robinson, we can criticize the tendencies of neuroscience, or at the very least reporting on neuroscience, to ignore the impact of both sociology and the humanities on our understanding of the self.</p>

<p>But why does this tendency to view the brain in isolation from society and the humanities matter? After all, neuroscience has the very specific goal of discovering how the brain works in a mechanical sense, exploring topics like where and how emotions manifest and whether differences exist between male and female brains. Any area of study must have its limitations, and as Robinson points out the very nature of science over the last two hundred years or so bars it from asking metaphysical questions about the soul, or even the self.</p>

<p>Fine and Robinson both take different angles on the question of why the limited focus of neuroscience is a problem, but both broadly criticize it for its overreach, the tendency to take a specific test result and make sweeping generalities about human nature. For Fine, the overreach lies in how neuroscience affirms and entrenches our tired old stereotypes of women — with the veneer of objective scientific truth but without consideration of the effect of centuries of patriarchy. For Robinson, the overreach lies in oversimplification, the notion that we can understand humanity by tracing where the brain lights up in a scanner. Both authors resist the essentializing of ourselves to the mechanisms of our brains, or at least to those mechanisms described in simple, cause-and-effect terms.</p>

<p>Neuroscience is just the latest in an extensive human tendency to oversimplify and essentialize human beings. Long before brain scans and modern neuroscience, the author Charlotte Brontë warns against reducing complex individuals to the mere sum of their parts. In Brontë&rsquo;s novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Jane makes a passionate speech to Mr. Rochester in which she proclaims: &ldquo;Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you, — and full as much heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brontë may not have had brain scans, but she was familiar with the nineteenth-century methods of essentializing people by class and gender. Given the social norms of the day, the wealthy, upper-class, male Mr. Rochester had every reason to believe that poor, lower-class, female Jane was, indeed, lacking in soul and heart, lacking in those characteristics that make one fully human.</p>

<p>Jane&rsquo;s declaration reminds Mr. Rochester — and us, dear reader — that Jane herself, her desires and talents and emotions and capabilities, cannot be boiled down to her class, gender, and dare I say brain scans. Brontë&rsquo;s heart-wrenching narrative of Jane&rsquo;s childhood emphasizes her extraordinary passion and sensitivity despite an upbringing designed to squash those characteristics.</p>

<p>And so, despite all the inputs that should push her to develop a poor, mean character, Jane clings to a self that is kind, generous, <em>good</em>, a self that is shaped by her circumstances but not in a mechanical, cause-and-effect manner. Yet she knows that when people see her, they often see not her unique self but the presumed product of poverty, charity and femininity — a product endowed with less heart and soul than an upper-class man.</p>

<p>Neuroscience has a similar tendency, reducing the complex web of the self to a measurable series of stimuli and responses. Neuroscience has, to be sure, great value: for example, understanding how stress can reshape our brains can give us greater empathy for those who encounter the daily stress of poverty or racism.</p>

<p>But Robinson and Fine, along with all the great novelists, remind us that we cannot reduce humans to their brain chemistry. Social context matters greatly, especially since brain science is still in its infancy. Even social context, though, cannot fully account for the self. For that, we must turn to the humanities to understand what it means to have a soul, to have a heart — to have those qualities that poor, little, obscure Jane claims, qualities that make her an equal to any other human being.</p>

<p>I think most of would agree that our self is something more than the chemistry or electrical impulses in our physical brains. And to understand something as complex and metaphysical of the self, we must not limit ourselves to neuroscience. Instead, we must draw on the resources of social science and the humanities as we strive to understand what it means to be human.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about Harvey Weinstein. Not because I don&rsquo;t care, or don&rsquo;t believe the accusations, or have nothing to say, but because I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m not shocked. I&rsquo;m not surprised. I&rsquo;m horrified, of course, although that reaction is dulled by too many repetitions of the same story.</p>

<p>But with #MeToo trending on Twitter as I write today, I feel the need to say something. It&rsquo;s not going to be something profound. It&rsquo;s not going to be the something that suddenly changes things for women. But it&rsquo;s one more something on the mound of stories and arguments and pleas that, maybe, someday, will grow into change.</p>

<p>When I say me too, I know I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones: I&rsquo;ve never been sexually assaulted. Just harassed. Just made to feel uncomfortable, just grateful to the friends — men and women — who&rsquo;ve looked out for me over the years, walking me to my car at night, warning me about the too-friendly professor, watching my drink at the bar.</p>

<p>In other words, just a typical woman.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem: I don&rsquo;t know any woman who hasn&rsquo;t experienced harassment in some form. It&rsquo;s everywhere, but that also means it&rsquo;s nowhere. Invisible.</p>

<p>Something like the allegations about Harvey Weinstein break onto the scene, and everyone is horrified. For a while. But we all know the pattern, because it happens so often: we feel outrage, but it seldom translates into an examination of why this keeps happening.</p>

<p>We start to distance ourselves. We chalk assault up to Hollywood culture. We have a hard time reconciling a genial figure peddling pudding in dorky sweaters with a habitual user of date rape drugs. We dismiss crude language about assaulting women as locker-room talk.</p>

<p>We wonder why women don&rsquo;t speak up about their experiences sooner, or louder, or somehow better. We read <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kMJV4o">op-eds</a> that suggest this sort of harassment happens to pretty women, less conservative women, women with less protective parents. We make this a liberal problem (Weinstein) or a conservative one (Roger Ailes), a worldly problem (Hugh Hefner) or a religious one (Bill Gothard).</p>

<p>As women, we are told and we tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re too sensitive, we can&rsquo;t take a joke, we&rsquo;re imagining things, we should be flattered by the attention. If we&rsquo;re careful enough, if we smile and nod, if we wear the right things and say the right things we&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Besides, how often does that sort of thing <em>really</em> happen?</p>

<p>And before we know it, we&rsquo;re back to normal — and maybe a career has ended, but more often nothing much happens and nothing much changes.</p>

<p>If we want this cycle to change, we must confront the fact that, as a society, we value women less than men. We find their pain less important than men&rsquo;s reputations. We believe them less, we subject them to greater scrutiny, we hold them to impossibly high standards.</p>

<p>This happens in churches and faith-based organization and in Hollywood. In academia and service industries. On the coasts and in rural Iowa. In Silicon Valley, in hospitals, in the C-suite, in factories. Women are harassed and assaulted by strangers and trusted friends, by colleagues and intimate partners, by bosses and subordinates.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m tired of people being periodically horrified by high-profile instances of assault. I want people to be horrified that half the population has to deal with harassment on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I want outrage and official action over the professors who have inappropriate contact with their students, not just a whisper network among women.</p>

<p>I want the comedian who tells a rape joke to hear horrified gasps, not laughter.</p>

<p>I want the pastor who delivers sexist jokes from the pulpit to be corrected by his parishioners, not allowed to persist.</p>

<p>I want the manager who touches inappropriately to be reprimanded, not ignored.</p>

<p>I want the colleague who makes off-color remarks to be ostracized, not excused.</p>

<p>I want the phrase &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo; stricken from our vocabulary.</p>

<p>I want to stop feeling so damn thankful that I&rsquo;ve only been harassed, not assaulted.</p>

<p>But until we work up the will as a culture to value women as human beings whose worth is equal to men, none of what I want will happen.</p></div>
