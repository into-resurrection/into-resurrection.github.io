<p>This week, the lectionary brings us into the Sermon on the Mount:</p>

<blockquote><p>“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.</p>

<p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>—Matthew 5:13-20, NIV</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I have a hard time with this passage. For me, it&rsquo;s wrapped up with the Evangelical culture war and with the narratives of (Christian) American exceptionalism that I was taught growing up. America was the City on a Hill, shining for all the world to see; in the era of the Moral Majority, being salt very often meant acquiring political power.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s the terrifying prospect of the salt losing its saltiness: what does that mean? how does it happen? As an anxiety-prone perfectionist, this felt like a threat from a God just waiting to be disappointed in me (a topic for another day …)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure, though, that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t mean to encourage either political power grabs or existential despair.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to be salt? To be light? And why follow this with a discussion of the law?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/different-from-and-good-to-kevin-miller">his sermon</a> this week, my rector made two helpful points that I&rsquo;m going to steal. First, he pointed out that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t tell us to become salt and light; he tells us that we <em>already are</em> salt and light. Yes, Jesus tells us to not lose our saltiness or hide our light. But for me, the emphasis shifts to how we use what we already have, instead of how we get or keep these characteristics.</p>

<p>Second, he titled his sermon &ldquo;Different From and Good To.&rdquo; Salt and light are different from other things — but they are meant to do good. Light, for example, is different from darkness, but it is good: it allows people to see where they are going or what they are doing. I very much appreciate this emphasis on how salt and light are good for the things around them.</p>

<p>So as followers of Jesus, we are salt and light, and we are meant to do good to our surroundings. (And although Jesus didn&rsquo;t say this, shining strongly and unexpectedly is little better than hiding the light — as I was reminded a few nights ago when my bedroom light mysteriously turned itself on at 2 am, disrupting the rest of my night …)</p>

<p>After this exhortation, however, Jesus veers into what seems at first to be a completely new topic: how he is coming not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. Clearly, there&rsquo;s a lot going on in these verses: what is the &ldquo;everything&rdquo; that Jesus plans to accomplish? What does it mean to have a righteousness that surpasses that of the Pharisees, the very people who clung most strongly to their identity as the people of God?</p>

<p>But with these words, Jesus wants to remind his audience about the covenants God made with Abraham and Isaac, covenants promising that all nations would be blessed through their offspring. About the laws given to Moses that command the people of Israel to treat the immigrant and the traveller well. About the prophets who chastise Israel for its failures to be good to even those within its borders, let alone those beyond them.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people have been meant to be salt and light since the beginning: they are meant to be good for the world around them. And the law and the prophets referenced by Jesus give us an idea of what being good for the world looks like. It looks like caring for the poor, the orphan and the widow. Like ensuring that justice is done. Like refusing to allow the wealthy to abuse and exploit the poor and powerless.</p>

<p>William Temple, an Anglican priest of the early twentieth century, is said to have claimed, &ldquo;The Church is the only institution that exists primarily for the benefit of those who are not its members.&rdquo; Clearly, this is sometimes more and other times less true of the Church. But Temple has hit on something vital. The church, as a community and as individuals, should bring God&rsquo;s goodness to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be salt and light? It means to love mercy, do justice, and walk humbly with God. It means to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Light in an already bright room is pointless; salt in a container in the cupboard has done nothing good. But when we as God&rsquo;s people are light and salt for those who need it, then the nations of the world are blessed through us.</p></div>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lectionary passage comes not from Matthew but from the Gospel of John:</p>

<blockquote><p>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.”</p>

<p>Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”</p>

<p>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</p>

<p>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.”</p>

<p>So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter).</p>

<p>— John 1:29-42, NIV</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot happening in this passage: John mentions Jesus' baptism (the subject of <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2020/01/baptism-of-our-lord">last week&rsquo;s lectionary</a> reading); John declares that Jesus is the Lamb of God on whom the Spirit of God has rested; some of John&rsquo;s disciples turn to Jesus, one of whom is Andrew; Andrew invites his brother, Simon, to come meet the man he believes is the Messiah.</p>

<p>In short: we could talk about baptism, about Jesus as the lamb, about following Jesus, and about evangelism. A rich passage indeed.</p>

<p>But one thing struck me in particular: twice John names Jesus as the &ldquo;Lamb of God.&rdquo; The first time John elaborates, describing the moment of Jesus' baptism. And in both this elaboration and in the first naming, John emphasizes that he did not know that Jesus was &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Chosen One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This constellation of statements fascinates me. Why does John the Evangelist emphasize both that Jesus is the Lamb of God <em>and</em> that John the Baptist did not at first recognize Jesus as the one coming after him?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious that John&rsquo;s surprise has something to do with Jesus as Messiah and Lamb. Because just like <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2020/01/epiphany">the Magi at Epiphany</a>, we expect a king to be, well, kingly. Born in a palace. Strong in battle. Charismatic. And if we&rsquo;re going to choose an animal to represent those qualities, we&rsquo;re not going to chose a lamb.</p>

<p>But this image of the Lamb who is also a king forms the central image in another text written by John the Evangelist. In Revelation 4 and 5, John has the central vision of God enthroned, surrounded by worshipping angels and elders. As chapter 5 begins, John writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p>

<p>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus is <em>simultaneously</em> the Lion and the Lamb, the King who conquers sin and evil and death by humbling himself in the Incarnation, by submitting himself to human suffering and death.</p>

<p>This should be shocking. It seems to have surprised John the Baptist; in the lectionary passage, he now recognizes Jesus as the Lamb of God who is the Chosen One of God — but it took a direct sign from God for John to see this truth about Jesus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawn for quite some time to stories about <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/tags/subversion">subversion in scripture</a>, stories where what we expect is reversed. Typically, the character who is weaker, or younger, or generally less powerful is favored by God over the stronger, more powerful character. Once you start looking, this pattern repeats all throughout the bible.</p>

<p>And Jesus is the ultimate subversion: God become a human being — and a human being in a normal family in an Israel ruled by a colonialist foreign power. The most powerful being in the universe, the creator and king, becomes a lamb — and more, a sacrificial lamb.</p>

<p>This should, without question, mean that Christians have a radically different conception of power than anyone else. The one being in the universe who is fully entitled to claim all power and authority, who has the power to demand all allegiance, chose instead to live and die as a human being subject to the oppressive power of imperial Rome.</p>

<p>And yet Jesus' power remained in the weakness. Ultimately, by dying he conquered death itself: a far more significant victory than dethroning a single Roman emperor. A victory that could only be won by a king who is also a lamb.</p>

<p>This is something different, something new. Something a little frightening that upends our categories for thinking about the world.</p>

<p>Like John the Baptist and Andrew and, although he doesn&rsquo;t know it yet in this passage, Simon Peter, we who are captivated by this Lamb who is a conquering king can do no better than to point to him. Look, the Lamb of God. Look, the Chosen One of God. Come and see the Messiah.</p>

<p>Because is there anything more amazing and more hopeful than a conquering king who is also a gentle lamb, a savior who lives and suffers and dies with us in order to bring us salvation from sin and evil and death?</p></div>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m trying a new thing on the blog, something to keep me writing every week and to help me think through the weekly lectionary readings: writing on the Gospel passage for each week. We&rsquo;re in Year A, which means that most passages come from the Gospel of Matthew; this week, the passage is the baptism of Jesus by John in the Jordan River.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>John the Baptizer preached: “I baptize with water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”</p>

<p>Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”</p>

<p>But Jesus said, “It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.” So John agreed to baptize him.</p>

<p>After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”</p>

<p>— Matthew 3:11-17, NLT</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of those passages that is so familiar to me that I forget how startling the story is. Here is John, calling his audience to repent because the Kingdom of God is at hand. He exhorts them to repent, to turn away from their old way of life towards a new one, and be baptized in the Jordan River, symbolically re-crossing into the Promised Land.</p>

<p>John is acutely aware that his job is to prepare people to receive this coming kingdom of God — not to bring that kingdom into existence; that job belongs to Jesus. And yet, here comes Jesus, asking to be baptized by John.</p>

<p>In Matthew&rsquo;s version of the baptism, John protests, asking why Jesus is coming for baptism. John&rsquo;s question sparks others: why should Jesus be baptized when he has nothing of which to repent? And why should he submit himself to John&rsquo;s lesser baptism of water when he is bringing the baptism of the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p>There are many possible answers to these questions, answers that overlap or enrich each other. We could see Jesus as submitting to God, functioning as a true Israelite, as the one who reverses Adam&rsquo;s sin — the point of baptism being obedience, not repentance.</p>

<p>In another angle, one commentator I read pointed out that the Greek word for &ldquo;repent&rdquo; connotes a turning or change; Jesus did not have to turn away from sin, but his baptism marks a change in his life as after this moment he begins his public ministry (<em>Feasting on the Word</em> p. 239).</p>

<p>But I am particularly drawn to thinking about the deep and rich symbolism of water: God&rsquo;s spirit broods over the water as creation begins. God destroys the earth with water. God nourishes the Israelites in the desert by providing water from a stone. God destroys the Egyptian army in water. God leads the Israelites through the Jordan River into a new home.</p>

<p>Water is life. Water is also death.</p>

<p>So what does it mean that Jesus, the living water incarnate, allows John to submerge him in the water of the Jordan?</p>

<p>Jesus' baptism initiates his ministry, a ministry that ends in his death, burial, and resurrection. As St. Paul tells us in both <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:3-5&amp;version=NIV">Romans</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+2%3A11-12&amp;version=NLT">Colossians</a>, in baptism we are buried with Christ and raised to new life; the baptism at the beginning of his ministry mingles together the waters of death and of life, foreshadowing Jesus' defeat of death through death.</p>

<p>Water destroys evil; in baptism, we die to sin and evil and death. Water is life; in baptism, we are raised to eternal life in Christ. Water marks a passage from the old into the new; in baptism, we are marked as Christ&rsquo;s own people.</p>

<p>And when Jesus is dipped into the Jordan River by his cousin John, the Living Water encounters and transforms the waters of cleansing and initiation and death. Now through baptism, we die to the life of sin and live into the life of Christ. Because when the Living Water becomes flesh, becomes a particular person in a particular time and place, all that he touches is transformed and infused with new meaning.</p>

<p>In his baptism, Jesus foreshadows his death and resurrection. But he also gives us a powerful symbol. When the water of baptism flows over us, and then whenever we see another person baptized, we are reminded to repent, to turn towards Jesus, and enter into the Kingdom of God.</p></div>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s 2020! As I was considering what to do with this space, I had an epiphany of sorts (see what I did there?): I want to get more practice preaching, but I don&rsquo;t have a place to preach on a regular basis (my kids are a less than enthusiastic audience …). So what if I use this space to write a weekly reflection on the lectionary readings?</em></p>

<p><em>So, starting today, each Monday the blog will feature a reflection on the lectionary readings (from the <a href="http://lectionarypage.net">Revised Common Lectionary</a>) for the previous Sunday. These pieces aren&rsquo;t sermons, but they will give me a way to think about a particular passage each week. And today I get to cheat a bit, since I did <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/the-light-has-come-sarah-lindsay">actually preach last Saturday</a> on the Epiphany texts.</em></p>

<p><em>I will still write on other topics; those will go up on most Thursdays — although this week, my monthly newsletter will go out on Thursday, so <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ede0b4433b84/sarah-lindsay">sign up now</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet done so!</em></p>

<p>Today is the Feast of Epiphany, a feast in the liturgical calendar that marks the end of the Christmas season (the twelve days of Christmas) and commemorates the visit of the Magi to Bethlehem, an event that reveals Jesus as messiah and king.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been Anglican, I&rsquo;ve grown to deeply appreciate the rhythms of the liturgical year: rhythms that take us through the story of Jesus every year, and more than that rhythms that build in blocks of time for fasting and for feasting, for acknowledging our need for a Savior and celebrating the in-breaking reality of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>But I must confess: Christmas is hard for me to celebrate. Maybe it&rsquo;s the weather; we celebrate the Light coming into the world, but here in Chicago at least we have months more of cold and dark. Maybe it&rsquo;s cultural; growing up, the Christmas tree always came down on January 1.</p>

<p>Maybe, though, it&rsquo;s because I often find that celebration requires as much discipline as fasting.</p>

<p>A discipline of celebration feels counterintuitive: shouldn&rsquo;t celebration be spontaneous, or at least effortless? But especially when it comes to rejoicing that our Savior is born and lived and died and rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, I think that discipline is necessary. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the ways that God is at work in the world around us, the ways that the kingdom of heaven is already breaking into the world. And so we must train ourselves to see and rejoice in the kingdom of God as it exists right now.</p>

<p>This is where the story of the Magi visiting the Christ child helps our discipline of celebration by pointing to what the kingdom of God looks like now.</p>

<p>First, the kingdom of God is a kingdom for everyone. The story of the Magi is so familiar to us that we forget, I think, how surprising it is that Matthew tells not of Jewish shepherds visiting the messiah — thematically appropriate characters, given that King David was a shepherd and God is constantly called the Shepherd of Israel — but of astrologers from a distant land.</p>

<p>Matthew is, of course, maddeningly vague about who the Magi are, where they come from, and what sort of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; they practice, although it must include astronomy and astrology (indistinguishable disciplines in the ancient world). But this is because none of that actually matters: what matters is that God sent a sign to people in a distant land and, through that sign, they were convinced that they needed to come pay homage to this new King of the Jews.</p>

<p>The Magi tell us, from the very beginning of Jesus' story, that God&rsquo;s kingdom isn&rsquo;t limited geographically; its inhabitants need not be any particular ethnicity. All that is required is to acknowledge Jesus as king — and this is very good news for us still.</p>

<p>Second, the kingdom of God can be found in unexpected places, and in places far removed from seats of worldly power. The Magi, quite naturally, assume that the king of the Jews would have been born in Jerusalem, in the palace of Herod. But instead, Jesus was born a normal child, in a family with no particular wealth or power, in a town of little political importance.</p>

<p>This is good news for us because it reminds us that we do not enter the kingdom of God via worldly power. God&rsquo;s power is not the power of wealth, political influence, or military might — and we do not need that power to gain the kingdom. We don&rsquo;t need to seek that power or place our hopes in those who wield those powers; that is not where the kingdom of God is found.</p>

<p>Third, even though the kingdom seems small and insignificant, its impact is anything but small. The birth of Jesus, although it was a cataclysmic event that reshaped human history <em>because the God who created us became one of us, became a part of the creation,</em> was not noticed by Herod or the scholars in Jerusalem. And yes, there was a sign in the stars — but only a few Magi, it seems, found it significant enough to undertake a long, expensive, dangerous journey to find the prophesied king.</p>

<p>But look at the effect: a group of people who upended their lives to come worship a king. And Matthew tells us nothing more of the Magi after they leave Bethlehem, but it hardly seems possible that their lives were ever the same again.</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t this always the way of the kingdom? Jesus says in Mathew 13 that the kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, like yeast: incredibly small, nearly invisible — but capable of a huge effect. The mustard seed grows into a huge plant, providing a home for many birds; the yeast works through the dough and produces food for many people.</p>

<p>This is where we return to the discipline of celebration: celebrating the coming of Jesus, the in-breaking of his kingdom, means looking for signs of the kingdom. It means seeing that the kingdom is for everyone, that it stands opposed to the power structures of the world, that it is constantly at work even when it seems invisible.</p>

<p>The discipline of celebration is thus a discipline of hope, of choosing to see the light even when the days are short and the nights long. And we can be inspired and encouraged by the Magi, who gave up their time, wealth, and even safety because they believed that the King whose star they saw was worthy of their sacrifice and homage.</p></div>

</figure></p>

<p>Last week, I was listening to an <a href="https://jayshetty.me/shazam/">interview with Zachary Levi</a>, star of <em>Chuck</em> (I&rsquo;m still angry about how that show ended) and, most recently, the DC film <em>Shazam.</em> It&rsquo;s a great interview; Levi talks about therapy, mental health, trust, gratitude, prayer, and his faith. I hadn&rsquo;t known that Levi is a Christian, but he spends a lot of this interview talking about how important his faith is to him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasant surprise to hear a Hollywood celebrity passionate about their relationship with God, but one thing struck me in particular: as Levi described his Christianity, he said that it is &ldquo;closer to Buddhist than Baptist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This line struck me because it encapsulates what I sometimes do when I talk about my faith. I&rsquo;m a Christian, yes, but not <em>that</em> kind of Christian. I distance myself in particular from evangelical Christianity, the strain of American Christianity that constantly struggles with fundamentalism, mires itself in culture wars, and all too often confuses political power with the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>I partly do this because I have theological values and convictions that don&rsquo;t mesh neatly with evangelicalism. But, let&rsquo;s be honest: I also partly do it because I don&rsquo;t want people to judge me. I don&rsquo;t want people to think that I support conversion therapy and screaming at women entering Planned Parenthood clinics, that I deny climate change and think God appointed Trump as our president and might still be iffy on interracial marriage.</p>

<p>I know that the above is a caricature, or at the very least representative of a minority of American evangelicals. And I have no compunction over distancing myself from the actions and rhetoric of that minority of evangelical Christians (<em>cough</em>Franklin Graham<em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>But I did grow up thinking that Christians were being persecuted in America. I was told that wavering on points of dogma was the same as rejecting Christianity. I believed that &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; especially pop culture, was separate from and even opposed to Christianity.</p>

<p>And then I discovered that actually, Christians disagree — have disagreed — about dogmas for centuries. I learned that Christianity is still culturally normative in America (with decreasing strength, but even Trump had to claim some form of Christian faith in order to win the presidency).</p>

<p>I even discovered that many &ldquo;secular&rdquo; cultural productions have deeply Christian themes (hello, <em>Harry Potter</em>) and that sometimes, culture is ahead of the church (#MeToo gave rise to #ChurchToo, not the other way around).</p>

<p>And as I threw off the baggage of the evangelical culture wars, I found myself more and more often making some version of Levi&rsquo;s statement: I&rsquo;m a Christian, but not like those crazy Baptists/fundamentalists/evangelicals over there.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s the line? What&rsquo;s the point where I say: yes, I do believe that, even though it&rsquo;s unpopular. When I say: my faith does require me to take this stand, to reject that belief, to criticize those decisions.</p>

<p>I led youth worship recently, and we talked about the tension between believing that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life and living in a society that embraces, to at least some extent, religious pluralism. Religious pluralism asserts that all religions have some truth, so can&rsquo;t everyone just coexist?</p>

<p>And regardless of whether anyone truly believes that religions are neutral or basically equal, religious pluralism certainly promotes respect and dialogue. (Whether it achieves those things is, of course, an entirely different question.) But that&rsquo;s the rub: how do you simultaneously assert that your faith is True — while also respecting that others disagree for a variety of reasons?</p>

<p>In the churches I grew up in, I didn&rsquo;t learn much respect for non-Christians; the assumption tended to be that they were either too ignorant to see its truth or that they willfully rejected the truth.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;more Buddhist than Baptist&rdquo; approach pulls back from any truth claims about Christianity, reducing it to a personal faith that has little to offer the world and few distinctive elements. Zachary Levi certainly finds strength and meaning in his faith, but it&rsquo;s not clear that he thinks others would as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any answers on how to thread the needle. But I wonder: what if we invite people into the great story of redemption? What if we invite people to taste and see that God is good?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to prove that the story is true. We don&rsquo;t need need to demand that people make a wholesale intellectual commitment.</p>

<p>But the story of Christianity, of God&rsquo;s love for the world God made, of Jesus coming to laugh and cry and sleep and eat and die with us, of the Spirit dwelling within us, is so much bigger than personal feelings of well-being. This is a story worth inviting others into.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not always sure that God is making all things new, righting all wrongs, drying all tears. Sometimes it seems like a story that&rsquo;s far too good to be true. But if it is true? It&rsquo;s the most beautiful story and I want a place in it. So I believe, not because I know that Jesus is the Way, but because I hope he is.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be more Buddhist than Baptist, or the other way around. I want to say yes to God&rsquo;s story and to live as if God&rsquo;s story is true. And more: I want to live out God&rsquo;s story in my own life and invite others to live in this story with me.</p>

<p>And yes, sometimes that might mean that I have to take an unpopular stand. Sometimes it means that I see God&rsquo;s story woven into the world around me. But maybe it&rsquo;s not about drawing lines, about dividing in and out; maybe it&rsquo;s just about the invitation into story about God&rsquo;s love for us.</p></div>
