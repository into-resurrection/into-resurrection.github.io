<p><em>Part 5 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, or <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>.</em></p>

<p>How do you feel about God today?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awkward question for me to write. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to <em>know</em> about God, not <em>feel</em> about him? Doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9">Jeremiah tell us</a> that the heart is deceitful above all things?</p>

<p>But living in a body means having emotions. Even if we try to deny, suppress or muscle through those emotions, they still exist, often manifesting in physical ways: hunched shoulders, clenched fists, butterflies, tears, laughter, relaxation. If we elevate mind over body, we also elevate mind over emotions — an elevation further exacerbated by the association of emotions with femininity and weakness.</p>

<p>But once again, the Incarnation forces us to think about the whole experience of having bodies: experience which includes emotions. The body incorporates both mind and emotion, and attempts to deny or diminish this ignore the created reality of our physical existence and experience.</p>

<p>Every person, of course, experiences emotions differently (and different cultures understand emotions <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">in different ways</a>). But emotions are a sign of being human, of having the capacity to respond to our world with more than just logic; emotions are a part of the divine image within humanity. Additionally, emotions are not somehow feminine; despite the way modern American culture suppresses men&rsquo;s emotions, men are not less emotional beings that women (and emotion is not feminine weakness).</p>

<p>We see Jesus experience and express emotions during his time on earth: his grief over the death of Lazarus, his weary need to withdraw from the crowds, his anger at the merchants and money-changers in the temple, his gentle exasperation with his disciples for misunderstanding his teachings. And more, we see Jesus experience and address his emotions. He weeps when he grieves and he goes to pray alone when he needs to rest from the demands of the crowd, rather than ignore or suppress his feelings.</p>

<p>I confess that emotions can be difficult for me. I tend to be controlled and reserved; I don&rsquo;t like feeling out of control emotionally, and it often seems safer to tuck emotions away rather than actually acknowledge and deal with them. And more, emotions aren&rsquo;t always a suitable guide for our actions or even a proportionate response to whatever evoked them. In short, emotions are messy, unpredictable, and often illogical.</p>

<p>But emotions can be good, as well. The joy of a child watching the first snow of winter. The upwelling of gratitude for the kindness of a friend. The flutters of love for a significant other. The peace of an ocean sunrise. Even our anger and grief can connect us to others and spur us to action.</p>

<p>The heart may be deceitful; we&rsquo;ve all experienced misleading emotional reactions. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that the heart is somehow more deceitful than the mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18-31">Paul reminds us</a> that the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of the world; human reason alone cannot get us all the way to God any more than human emotion can.</p>

<p>God gives us both reason and emotion, and both have their place. In fallen, sinful human bodies, neither can be wholly trusted — but neither can be wholly dismissed. Emotion can temper our reason, reminding us that real people are affected by the rational arguments that we make on any number of topics. And reason can temper emotion, helping to move us beyond our initial reactions.</p>

<p>When we insist on logic and dismiss emotions as deceptive, we buy into a valuation of body and emotion rooted in Greek philosophy, not God&rsquo;s created reality. This denigration of our emotional selves emerges especially from strains of theology that emphasize orthodoxy (that <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">right mental furniture</a>) over orthopraxy, and from theologies that prize authority over experience. Both tell us to suppress emotions in favor of reason, whether our own or that of an authority figure (or a combination of both). I should note that this is my own tradition; the holiness tradition often goes in the opposite direction, valuing emotion above reason, and both imbalances can be dangerous.</p>

<p>You may also notice, reading this post, that I&rsquo;m trying to use rational argument to show that we should value emotion. Most people, it seems, gravitate to one over the other; I gravitate towards reason (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re shocked to learn). But despite our own tendencies, we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss our emotional selves.</p>

<p>To do so denies our created reality and thus denies the reality of the Incarnation, which placed immeasurable value on our created bodies.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 4 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a> and <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3 here</a></em></p>

<p>Over the last three posts, I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the ramification of the Incarnation — for bodies, for systems of belief, for women. But Advent is about both the already and the not yet: the world in which we live and believe and work and grieve and laugh, and the fully redeemed world for which we hope. Advent asks us to remember that Christ came, as a baby in a stable, and that he will one day come again.</p>

<p>Advent asks us to hold together the past and future, to step for a moment out of the linear time of alarm clocks and shopping days that rules our daily lives. Advent reminds that we are waiting for the coming savior, like Anna and Simeon at the temple, like Elizabeth and Zechariah, like the prophets of old.</p>

<p>And Advent should remind us that when the savior comes, it may not look like we expect.</p>

<p>The Christmas story is so familiar to most of us as to be almost banal. The manger, the shepherds, the wise men — we know the drill. Plus, we&rsquo;re used to the sanitized version, the adorable kids in lamb costumes, the nativities carefully unwrapped from tissue paper. Even if we understand how radical it was for Christ, the creator of the universe, to be born to a humble family in the humblest of circumstances, it can be hard to fully grasp how different this was from how most first-century Jews would have imagined the birth of their savior.</p>

<p>But we should be humbled by this reminder: how might Christ&rsquo;s second coming look different from what we imagine? And I don&rsquo;t just mean different from the predictions of a Harold Camping or Hal Lindsey (or, dare I say, a Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins). If God first came in the humblest possible manner, and proceeded to live a life amongst the poor and oppressed and sinful people of a conquered territory, what does this suggest about his second coming?</p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed, we affirm that Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead — and if we&rsquo;re honest, we either ignore that part (judgment is often unpleasant) or assume that it will apply to others: Christ will judge people who actually deserve it, a group that surely does not include us. I think it&rsquo;s plain old human nature to assume that Jesus will affirm our rightness, or at least extend us grace, while hoping (secretly or not) for him to condemn others.</p>

<p>But the New Testament is full of warnings about judgment: I mentioned the passage in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46">Matthew</a> last week, where Jesus sends away those who did not feed the hungry or clothe the naked because what they did not do &ldquo;to the least of these&rdquo; they did not do to Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7:21-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a> even more clearly states that not everyone who says &ldquo;lord, lord&rdquo; to Jesus will be saved. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+3&amp;version=NIV">1 John 3</a>, the apostle John warns us that if we do not love we are murderers — and that we must love with actions, not just words.</p>

<p>These are uncomfortable passages, especially for us <em>sola fide</em> protestants; they carry the impression that our actions, and not just our mental faith furniture, matter for our salvation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tear down one of the pillars of the Reformation, although I will note that orthodox Christianity in all its forms affirms both truths that only God can save and that our actions here on earth matter. So when we think of Christ returning in glory and judgment, we have to consider our own actions and how they align with the kingdom that Jesus inaugurated with his first coming.</p>

<p>And what does that kingdom look like? What sort of world do we see Jesus pointing towards in his time on earth?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a kingdom of healing, both physical and spiritual. It&rsquo;s a kingdom of grace for sinners. It&rsquo;s a kingdom that has no place for the rich and prideful, for those who jockey for positions of power and authority, for those who place heavy religious burdens on the backs of others. It&rsquo;s a kingdom inherited by the meek, built by the peacemakers, inhabited by the poor in spirit. It&rsquo;s a kingdom where a worker can get a full day&rsquo;s wage for just a few hours of work, where a heartbreaking disappointment of a son is welcomed home with open arms, where each individual matters regardless of their station in life.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the kingdom that Christ inaugurated with his incarnation, death and resurrection, his return will likely also disrupt and upend the systems that seem so natural and right to us today. And so even as we hope and long for Christ&rsquo;s return, we must do so with humility and the sober awareness that we might just be the Romans and the Pharisees rather than the least of these.</p>

<p>This is a challenge for me, to be sure. Tidy categories of right and wrong make judgment much easier to contemplate. And believing the right thing is simpler than doing the right thing. I do believe that sin exists and that beliefs matter. But as I&rsquo;ve discussed in the last several posts, the Incarnation means that we cannot stop at belief; what we do with our bodies in the physical world also matters. As members of the already-and-not-yet kingdom, we will inevitably fail to fully live into the tangible peace and justice and love of that kingdom — but we are to try anyway.</p>

<p>So this Advent season, may we remember Jesus' first coming and look forward to his second. And may we remember that his first coming upended any conventional idea about what it would mean for God to dwell among us, as one of us. Let us not become complacent that our right beliefs will insulate us from judgment, and let us not grow weary in doing good.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 3 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a></em></p>

<p>The season of Advent reminds us that God took on human flesh; it also reminds us that this process requires women willing to allow God to work through their bodies. Women play vital roles in the Christmas story: Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; Anna, awaiting the Messiah in the temple; the Old Testament women — Tamar, Rahab, Ruth — mentioned in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus. And always Mary, whose faith and courage made her the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to focus on the men around Jesus: the genealogies, the shepherds, the wise men, the apostles. But the physicality of the Incarnation demands that women be a part of the story, and indeed we see women present from the manger to the cross to the resurrection, with Jesus at every key moment of the gospel story.</p>

<p>Jesus may have become God incarnate as a human man, but from Mary onward we never see Jesus treat women as anything less than co-heirs of his kingdom, equally created in the image of God. This is especially important because western civilization from before Jesus' time all the way through to ours has devalued bodies and women, elevating men and reason instead.</p>

<p>Patriarchy has been prevalent for most of human history, it seems — one of the first sins out of Eden. But in Greek culture, patriarchy combined with Platonism led to the association of women with the body and men with the mind. This association has morphed over the last two and a half millennia, but it still underlies assumptions about women: women are hormonal and emotional; women are vain and overly concerned with their bodies; women are less capable of logic and reason.</p>

<p>But the Incarnation upends these ideas about women and bodies: both are crucial to God&rsquo;s plan for redeeming and restoring humanity.</p>

<p>This is good news indeed for women.</p>

<p>At least in modern-day western culture (my own experience), women are constantly either told that their bodies are a problem or reduced to simply their bodies. The checkout lane at the supermarket shows both: discipline your body through diet and exercise — so that you can wield the power of a perfectly shaped body.</p>

<p>And we can&rsquo;t feel superior as Christians, since churches are seldom much better: purity culture, along with the even wider-spread Billy Graham (or Mike Pence) rule, frame women&rsquo;s bodies as inherently sinful, so tempting that they must be covered up and kept away from men. Additionally, churches that forbid women from holding leadership positions often do so with the argument that women are more easily deceived and less capable of leadership — code for being less rational than men.</p>

<p>We should certainly question the association of women with the body, since men are no less embodied and women are no less rational. But devaluing women tends to accompany devaluing bodies, and the Incarnation directly challenges both by elevating women and bodies.</p>

<p>What does this mean for women today, that Jesus came into the world through the body of a faithful woman?</p>

<p>It means that the process of childbirth is important labor, and ought to be valued and respected rather than regarded as an inconvenience to employers and the non-pregnant.</p>

<p>It means that women are more than their physicality, and especially more than their sexuality: Mary&rsquo;s body was important, but equally important was her faith, her consent to bear the son of God.</p>

<p>It means that women are not dangerous temptresses incapable of not seducing men; instead, they are companions to Jesus and vital workers in his kingdom from the time of the patriarchs through the present day.</p>

<p>It means that women, like men, are fully created in the image of God with all the privileges and responsibilities of such a high position within creation.</p>

<p>The Incarnation is good news for all, since God loved his creation enough to become part of that creation. And for women, devalued, sexualized, reduced to their bodies, the Incarnation is very good news indeed.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 2 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a></em></p>

<p>Several years ago, my husband and I were part of a small group that watched <em>The Truth Project</em>, a video series produced by Focus on the Family. I have plenty of varied critiques of the material, but one phrase — often repeated by the main presenter — has stuck with me: he asked what the world would look like if we &ldquo;really believed&rdquo; what we claim to believe.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the phrase is that earnest mental commitment to a set of beliefs will, inevitably, change the way we live. But notice the emphasis: we need to work harder to <strong>believe</strong> the right things, to &ldquo;really&rdquo; believe. The orthodoxy (right beliefs) must, in this view, precede the orthopraxy (right doing).</p>

<p>But what does that mean? And why so much emphasis on our mental state?</p>

<p>Protestant theology in particular has a history of emphasizing salvation by grace through faith, rather than through works (although orthodox Christianity in all forms affirms that only Christ can bring about salvation). Additionally, Protestant theology was deeply entwined with Renaissance humanism, the sweeping intellectual movement running alongside the Reformation.</p>

<p>This intellectual grounding, plus a desire to avoid works-based theologies, meshed with the ever-present Platonism of western culture that values the mind (the metaphysical) over the body (the physical). And this results in a strain of Christianity that emphasizes right thinking, right believing, over all else.</p>

<p>In this vision of Christianity, the most crucial thing is to have the right mental furniture arranged in the right mental order. No papers scattered on the coffee table, no comfy but ugly couches, no chairs sitting askew; our intellectual house must be in order.</p>

<p>I confess, I like tidy mental systems and neat intellectual arguments; I want my mental faith furniture to have good feng shui, if I may be permitted a mixed metaphor. Clearly, what we believe shapes how we live in significant ways.</p>

<p>And yet. Can Christianity really be primarily about mental furniture? About the strength of our intellectual beliefs?</p>

<p>I think that the Incarnation gives a resounding NO to that question. God&rsquo;s great love for us was not only spiritual or metaphysical: love took on human flesh, <em>suffering</em> human flesh, in the person of Jesus Christ. Love became incarnate, became tangible, carried by a poor teenage girl and born in the lowliest of places. If the greatest expression of God&rsquo;s love required a human body, how can we return and reflect that love apart from our bodies?</p>

<p>One of the most sobering passages in the bible is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. Here, Jesus envisions final judgment, saying to the righteous:</p>

<blockquote><p>For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p></blockquote>

<p>James tells us that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14-26&amp;version=NIV">faith without works is dead</a>; Paul tells us that all the spiritual accomplishments in the world <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">are nothing without love</a>. We can really believe all we want, but until that belief becomes love and takes on flesh, becoming embodied in the world, all that belief is meaningless. The intellectual furniture matters only inasmuch as it becomes embodied in food for the hungry, clothes for the needy, company for the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> believe in God all the time. Some days, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to look at the wrongs of the world and believe that a good God is somehow present. Some days, the hope of resurrection seems like a beautiful but impossible dream. Some days, my prayers hover in the corner of my ceiling and seem to vanish into nothingness.</p>

<p>But forcing myself into some sort of intellectual certainty doesn&rsquo;t help on those days. What helps? Drinking coffee with a friend. Cuddling with a blanket, a book, and a child. Taking a meal to new parents. Opening my home to giggling 8-year-olds and their math homework. Volunteering with an organization that helps the hurting. Jesus tells us to love God and love others: how can we do that if we don&rsquo;t embody love, incarnate love?</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s love became a man, became a body, became relationships and shared tears and physical touch, broken bread and blood spilled out like wine. Our theology must reflect this, must include the body as well as the mind.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Paul, if I have the most perfectly arranged mental furniture but I never turn those beliefs into action, I have nothing. If the greatest love of all must become flesh, how can I respond except by incarnating my love in physical actions?</p></div>

<p><em>Part 1 of an Advent series on incarnation.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday began the season of Advent, the weeks of anticipation and longing leading up to the celebration of Christmas. In these days before Christmas we recall the longing for the Messiah, fulfilled with the birth of Christ, and remind ourselves that we are still longing for the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. Much like Lent, Advent reminds us that we need a savior — and that our savior has come, born in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Advent is about the longing, about the hope of a candle lit against the darkness. It&rsquo;s also about the fact that Christ has come, that he was born to a woman in a particular time and place, that God dwelt amongst humanity. Advent is about incarnation: both the Incarnation, God become human, and incarnation, the fact of our physical bodies and the longing for the restoration of God&rsquo;s very good creation.</p>

<p>When we sing about sweet baby Jesus, silent in the manger, or when we set up our sanitized nativities, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the breathtaking reality of incarnation. Not only did God become a human being, but God did so in the most messy, most human way possible: childbirth.</p>

<p>What a breathtaking affirmation of the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<p>In my experience, we modern western Christians are not particularly good at thinking about the material creation. We are heirs not just to Christianity but also to Plato — whose articulation of the separation between the illusory material world and real world of ideal forms undergirds centuries of philosophy. Plato&rsquo;s conception of a reality beyond the material world meshes in many ways with Christianity, but with the unfortunate side effect of elevating the spiritual above the physical.</p>

<p>Elevating the spiritual or metaphysical over the material or physical is especially easy because of the way that sin has marred the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation. We develop arthritis, catch colds, fight cancer, experience heart failure. We often view our bodies as limitations, as weights that hold the true us (whatever that may be) back from fulfilling our potential.</p>

<p>But when we denigrate our physical bodies, we forget that when God made humankind and thus completed creation, God said that it — creation, the material world — was <strong>very</strong> good. And while sin may mar that goodness, it cannot erase it: our bodies were created very good, and will one day be recreated and restored to that goodness.</p>

<p>When God chose to come to earth as Jesus, he chose to take on the flesh that he had created. He chose to inhabit a physical body, to experience the joys and indignities of the body. And more, he chose to be born, to experience the fullness of human life from helpless baby, to unsteady toddler, to hormonal teenager, to suffering adult.</p>

<p>God didn&rsquo;t cheat, creating a body for himself out of nothing, or creating a perfect body. And the doctrine of the Incarnation says that his physical body wasn&rsquo;t just some shell, some avatar; rather, Jesus was fully human just as he was fully divine. Jesus&rsquo;s willingness to take on flesh shows a respect for and a profound love for the material body.</p>

<p>The Incarnation suggests that God redeems humanity not by separating the spiritual from the physical but by healing and integrating both. And so over the next three weeks, I&rsquo;ll be exploring what this means: how should the Incarnation shape our thinking about the material world, and our bodies in particular? What does it mean that the center of our theology is a God who willingly became human flesh? How do we live in the tension between the very good creation and the very real physical effects of sin?</p>

<p>The first candle in the Advent wreath is the prophecy candle, or the candle of hope. As we live in the tension between the promise and fulfillment, may the incarnation give us hope that all creation — material and immaterial — will ultimately be redeemed and once again made very good.</p></div>
