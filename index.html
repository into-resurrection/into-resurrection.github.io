    <div class="body"><p><em>Part of a recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture</a> in which I highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority, our notions of who is &ldquo;in&rdquo; and who is &ldquo;out.&rdquo; When Jesus became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire in order to conquer a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire, he upended our comfortable notions about how power works. But if we pay attention, we see these subversions of power over and over in scripture.</em></p>

<p>For my first post in this series, I wrote about <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/06/subversion-tamar">Tamar and Judah</a>. Despite the fact that she tricked her father-in-law into getting her pregnant, Tamar is not only called righteous at the time but Matthew also includes her as one of only four women in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar&rsquo;s story reminds us that God cares about the marginalized and seeks justice for the wronged and oppressed, flipping our ideas of power upside down.</p>

<p>The next woman included in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus,</a> however, doesn&rsquo;t point to the righting of injustices. Instead, this woman — Rahab the prostitute from Jericho — challenges our ideas about who can be a part of God&rsquo;s people, subverting our tribal conceptions of insider and outsider.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+2&amp;version=NIV">Rahab&rsquo;s story</a> is straightforward: she lives in the city of Jericho, and she along with all the inhabitants of that city know that they are the next target of the Israelites — the people who are conquering and settling the land to the west of the Jordan River. When two spies from the Israelite camp enter Jericho, they stay at Rahab&rsquo;s inn. Rahab hides the spies from city authorities and, in return, demands protection for herself and her family when the Israelites invade.</p>

<p>The spies and Rahab make an elaborate series of promises, and both sides <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:15-25&amp;version=NIV">keep their words:</a> Rahab helps the spies escape and hangs the identifying red cord in her window, and when the Israelites attack and defeat the city they not only spare Rahab and her family but then allow Rahab&rsquo;s family to live in the Israelite camp — where, the author of Joshua informs his audience, Rahab lives <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:25&amp;version=NIV">&ldquo;to this day.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>From this story, Rahab comes across as savvy and opportunistic: she sees the writing on the wall<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for Jericho and she secures safety for her family. Which is good for her, certainly, and suggests that she thought the Israelites' God was stronger than her own. But she seems more interested in self-preservation than in theology, more motivated by her desire to live than by any encounter with the God of Israel.</p>

<p>In short, Rahab both by virtue of her profession (prostitute) and her opportunism seems an unlikely candidate for inclusion in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And yet there she is, appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy as the mother of Boaz, who himself marries another foreign woman, Ruth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Why might Rahab merit inclusion?</p>

<p>The writer of Hebrews gives us one clue: &ldquo;By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient&rdquo; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11:31&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 11:31</a>. Although the book of Joshua only has Rahab acknowledging the superior military power of the God of the Israelites, the writer of Hebrews credits this as faith in God, faith that God is indeed powerful.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s faith, or belief in the power of God, results in her salvation as Joshua insists that she and her family be spared in the destruction of Jericho and also be allowed to live among the Israelites. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that she isn&rsquo;t an Israelite herself, or that her faith was spurred by her fear of death. She is not only saved from death but saved into the larger community of God&rsquo;s people, ultimately appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And so Rahab challenges our notions of who gets to be part of God&rsquo;s kingdom. To put it one (fairly Calvinist) way, God does the choosing, not us; from another point of view, God accepts all who come, rewards those who trust.</p>

<p>Rahab and her family are the foreigners, the all-too-often-feared Other. Although scripture records no reaction to the inclusion of Rahab and her family in the Israelite camp, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that some Israelites viewed them with distrust or disgust. She betrayed her people once; would she do it again? She chose a new God, but what old practices did she cling to that might infect others?</p>

<p>But instead of being quarantined off from God&rsquo;s people or treated as a second-class citizen, Rahab is instead lifted up and honored. She points us towards the inclusiveness of God&rsquo;s kingdom, a kingdom that embraces the stranger, that transcends our fallen human impulse to exclude the Other.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s presence in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy tells us that we must not assume that a person is an outsider to the Church, to God, because they do not fit our idea of what an insider should be. Let us be challenged by Rahab&rsquo;s story and let us work to reflect in our communities and our churches the wonder of people from every tongue and tribe and nation coming together to worship God.</p>

<p>After an unplanned but much-needed two-week hiatus, I&rsquo;m back! As <em>Into Resurrection</em> approaches its first anniversary, I have been reflecting on where I see it going in the future. I don&rsquo;t intend to stop writing here any time soon — but I think it&rsquo;s time to make a few changes.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;ll only be posting a substantial piece once a week, on Tuesdays. On Fridays, I plan to post something short and more off-the-cuff. In addition to these posts, though, I&rsquo;m launching a bi-weekly newsletter! Stay tuned for info on how to subscribe. This newsletter will have a more personal update, links to great articles I&rsquo;ve read or to pieces I&rsquo;ve written, and (inevitably) a book or two to add to your TBR pile.</p>

<p>And what, you ask, will I be doing in all my spare time? Excellent question!</p>

<p>I am now working part-time for my church, as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministry  and as Communications Coordinator. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be on staff because I love my new colleagues and because I&rsquo;m happy to turn my administrative skills to good use.</p>

<p>But the other reason I&rsquo;m excited to be on staff at my church is that I&rsquo;m in the process of exploring a call to pastoral ministry — specifically, the priesthood.</p>

<p>Whew. Saying that out loud is still so strange to me.</p>

<p>When I decided to resign my teaching position 20 months ago, I never could have imagined that pastoral ministry might be in my future. But this seems to be a path that I need to follow for now, and when I&rsquo;m not surprised or terrified I&rsquo;m really excited to see where this will lead.</p>

<p>Also, in between working and writing for this blog and preaching the occasional sermon, I&rsquo;m beginning to write articles for other publications and starting on a book about faith and feminism. As I work out ideas for my book, expect to see more blog content on the place of feminism within Christianity — I have a whole stack of books that I&rsquo;m excited to dive into.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to write about subversion in scripture — Rahab is coming up next month — and about women in Christianity. And in September, I want to jump off from a rather ridiculous Gospel Coalition piece that divided food in to &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in order to think about gender essentialism.</p>

<p>I was in academia for so long that the start of a new school year feels more like a new year than January 1st. So I&rsquo;m excited to go into this new (school) year with a new plan for the blog, a new newsletter, a new job, a new calling. I hope that you&rsquo;ll stick with me as I continuing moving into this new season of my life!</p></div>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about the situation at Willow Creek. I have no special insights, no particular connection beyond gratitude for its prominence as an egalitarian congregation. I was thrilled a year ago when Willow announced that their new lead pastor, the successor to Bill Hybels, <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/october/willow-creek-bill-hybels-names-co-ed-pastors-to-succeed.html">would be a woman.</a></p>

<p>But the slow-moving train wreck at Willow Creek over allegations that Bill Hybels <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-willow-creek-pastor-20171220-story.html#">acted inappropriately</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/bill-hybels-willow-creek-pat-baranowski.html">towards multiple women</a> is a painful reminder that egalitarian theology isn&rsquo;t enough to protect women from men willing to abuse their power.</p>

<p>I would like to think that egalitarian theology automatically creates a better atmosphere for women. Because as much as I grieve for the many women hurt by the actions of leaders in the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to see these abuses as the natural outgrowth of theologies that treat women as subordinate to men. It&rsquo;s much harder when the abuses occur in churches with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; theology.</p>

<p>I do think that complementarian theology creates a culture ripe for abuse. And I believe that egalitarian theology, a theology that maintains the full equality and humanity of men and women, can help protect against the abuse of women.</p>

<p>But the difficult reality revealed by Willow Creek is that no theological system can fully protect women. While complementarian theology can hide abuse under the veneer of biblical faithfulness, egalitarian theology can blind us to abuse because we imagine that this right theological framework automatically translates into the right treatment of women.</p>

<p>As Willow Creek demonstrates, though, someone like Bill Hybels can simultaneously believe that a woman is fully qualified to succeed him in ministry while also, allegedly, treating some women as objects for his own sexual gratification.</p>

<p>In the wake of the resignation of the entire elder board and the lead pastors of Willow Creek last week, <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/08/10/beaty-oped/">Katelyn Beaty argued</a> that the problem is not, at its core, about misogyny or sexual misconduct; instead, the problem is the blindness of the American evangelical church to power.</p>

<p>I agree with Beaty that power is the elephant in the room, and that any way forward for Willow that refuses to address power will fail to prevent similar problems in the future.</p>

<p>The events at Willow Creek should be a sobering reminder for all of us who hold egalitarian theology. If our view of women in the church does not address the power structures — the powers and principalities of the world — that elevate men over women, we end up with an empty theology, pretty words that cannot accomplish their promise of equality for women.</p>

<p>Addressing the power of patriarchy is a far more difficult task than inviting the occasional woman to preach or even hiring women to lead. But unless we are willing to do that hard work, egalitarian theology will never be able to fully liberate women to serve alongside men and freely use their gifts to build up the church. Egalitarian theology will become yet another &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; mask under which women are still treated as less than men.</p>

<p><em>I highly recommend Scot McKnight&rsquo;s blog posts outlining the events at Willow over the last few years that have led up to this scandal,</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/08/06/willow-your-time-is-now/">here</a> <em>and</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/06/27/about-willow-creek-what-do-i-think/">here.</a></p></div>

<p>My youngest daughter loves my &ldquo;fluffy tummy.&rdquo; Let me see it, Mommy, she begs; lifts up my shirt; buries her head in my belly. You&rsquo;re so soft, she says.</p>

<p>Tell me why it&rsquo;s so fluffy, she asks. She knows the answer: because I grew three big, beautiful babies in my body. But she wants to hear, again, that my belly is tangible proof that she was once a part of me.</p>

<p>She loves my soft, squishy, fluffy tummy so much that I can&rsquo;t bear to tell her my truth:</p>

<p>I hate it.</p>

<p>To me, my belly fat doesn&rsquo;t represent three pregnancies that happened alongside a PhD, a cross-country move, a new job, so many good and hard things in my life. Instead, it represents failure. Lack of discipline and self-control.</p>

<p>My belly betrays that I&rsquo;d rather sleep than pry myself out of bed and hit the gym. It reveals that I think chocolate tastes better than skinny feels. It shows how much I enjoy eating the bread that I love baking.</p>

<p>The jiggle in my thighs proves that I cannot bring my mind to bear over matter. That I have failed to discipline my genetic predisposition to squishiness into lean muscle.</p>

<p>What my daughter sees as physical evidence of love and comfort and connection I see as failure of the will.</p>

<p>And so I found Nicole Morgan&rsquo;s new book, <em>Fat and Faithful,</em> incredibly challenging. In her book, Morgan makes a strong case for recognizing the image of God in <em>every</em> body, regardless of how far that body strays from our cultural ideas of a &ldquo;good&rdquo; body.</p>

<p>From this starting point, Morgan strongly criticizes the Christian diet industry, and indeed our modern-day understanding of the sin of gluttony. She argues that our association of skinniness with holiness is not only cultural but damaging as it devalues the personhood of those who do not, or cannot, achieve a &ldquo;good&rdquo; body.</p>

<p>Although the book is not a memoir, Morgan uses her own experiences as a fat woman in the church to illustrate the heartbreaking pressure and dehumanizing assumptions she faced and, at times, internalized. As a young woman, she believed that her large body negated her words, that no one would come to Christ through her because she lacked the faith and discipline to lose weight.</p>

<p>Morgan is absolutely right that the church, like the rest of the culture, prizes thinness — and she drives home the necessary point that the church does great damage when it equates fatness with sinfulness.</p>

<p>I also appreciate her point that an obsession with how and what we eat — calorie counting, labeling foods &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; berating ourselves for cheating — gets in the way of joyful communal tables. I&rsquo;ve agonized myself over how people might perceive my own food choices at communal meals, and that internal agony does nothing to enhance community.</p>

<p>Morgan makes good and important points about loving and accepting our bodies, and about how the church has failed to honor the image of God in bodies that exist outside cultural ideals of beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>But I still struggle with the idea of fat acceptance, especially for myself. I find myself able to extend grace and acceptance to others that I just can&rsquo;t seem to apply to myself.</p>

<p>I know that I&rsquo;m not as disciplined with my eating and exercising as I could be. I eat far too much sugar and too many carbs. I don&rsquo;t exercise as much as I should. I ended one gym membership when I moved this spring, and I haven&rsquo;t managed to actually sign up at the new gym I&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>

<p>I want to be healthy — that&rsquo;s part of my motivation, and not bad — but I also want to be closer to my pre-pregnancy body. Maybe even my pre-PhD-exams body. I&rsquo;ve never loved my body, but I now regret not loving it more when I was far closer to social ideals.</p>

<p>And after years of living as a woman in America, it&rsquo;s incredibly hard for me to disentangle &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; from &ldquo;thin.&rdquo; I want to bike with my kids. Physical activity lifts my mood. I feel crappy when I eat too much sugar. But when I swap fresh fruit for ice cream and a brisk walk for a Netflix binge and I don&rsquo;t lose weight, I wonder if it&rsquo;s worth the effort. I let my scale tell me whether or not I should feel good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to love this body that I live in. I&rsquo;m not even convinced in my heart of hearts that I should love it, at least not until I manage to remake it into something else, something disciplined, something skinny, something perfect. Something impossible.</p>

<p>So <em>Fat and Faithful</em> challenges me on a personal level. Can I love my body even in its imperfections? Can I love my body enough to care for it rather than punish it into compliance? Can I love my body as God does, as part of God&rsquo;s good creation?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t do it right now. It seems impossible that I will ever love my fluffy tummy the way my daughter does.</p>

<p>But I can start by accepting that she loves it rather than telling her that she should feel differently.</p></div>

<p><em>The final installment in a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Catch up with <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-3">Part 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-4">Part 4.</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>
So you&rsquo;ve read the last several blog posts and decided to add more women to your reading list. Great! There are so very, very many excellent books by women that this blog post could expand to ridiculous proportions. But I will attempt to restrain myself and recommend some books.</p>

<p>I am limiting myself to women who write in English, although this reveals another type of myopia. Plus, this is a <em>very</em> short list of women writers I particularly like or have been particularly challenged by; take these books as recommendations, not a comprehensive education or even introduction to literature by women.</p>

<p><strong>Pre- and Early Modern Writers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sappho, poems: both revered for her skill and vilified for excelling in a male-dominated art, Sappho deserves to be read alongside Homer. I particularly like the translation by Anne Carson titled <a href="https://amzn.to/2mSOTLl"><em>If Not, Winter.</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>Marie de France, <a href="https://amzn.to/2v0E4LA"><em>Lais</em>:</a> short romances, written in the twelfth century, that explore the nature of love and desire.</p></li>
<li><p>Julian of Norwich, <a href="https://amzn.to/2K6rlvx"><em>Revelation of Divine Love</em>:</a> mystical theology that reflects on God&rsquo;s great love for us despite our sinfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Aemilia Lanyer, <a href="https://www.usask.ca/english/phoenix/lanyerpoems1.htm">&ldquo;The Defense of Eve&rdquo;:</a> in this poem, Lanyer makes a strong argument for not blaming Eve alone for the Fall.</p></li>
<li><p>Mary Sidney, <a href="https://amzn.to/2LSixhW"><em>Psalms</em>:</a> Mary completed her brother Philip&rsquo;s English verse translations of the Psalms, and probably edited the ones her brother wrote as well; her translations beautifully render these ancient poems.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Seventeenth through Nineteenth Centuries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Aphra Behn, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Amhv99"><em>Oronoko</em>:</a> a tragic novel about the evils of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.</p></li>
<li><p>Mary Shelley, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NWjLpH"><em>Frankenstein</em>:</a> man tries to create life, and instead creates something monstrous by usurping God and (mother) nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Jane Austen, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OqSCfz"><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2mR9zmM"><em>Emma</em>:</a> these may be novels about women getting married, but they&rsquo;re keenly observed and funny as hell.</p></li>
<li><p>Mary Wollstonecraft, <a href="https://amzn.to/2v2dW2K"><em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>:</a> an early feminist classic.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Twentieth Century and Beyond: Fiction and Poetry</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Virginia Woolf, <a href="https://amzn.to/2K5a7id"><em>To the Lighthouse.</em></a> A classic novel that explores the limitations that women face.</p></li>
<li><p>Sylvia Plath, poems: Plath&rsquo;s poetry transmutes the raw anger and despair of her female experience into tragically beautiful verse.</p></li>
<li><p>Marilynne Robinson, novels and essays: I could substitute Flannery O'Connor here; these two women explore the ordinary living out of faith — in all its joy and heartbreak — better than nearly anyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>Dorothy Sayers, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OsFgiJ"><em>Gaudy Night</em>:</a> one of her Peter Wimsey mystery novels, <em>Gaudy Night</em> has very little Peter and no dead body at all. The action takes place at a women&rsquo;s college in Oxford, and explores the difficult decisions faced by women seeking to balance love, family and work.</p></li>
<li><p>Chimamanda Adichie, <a href="https://amzn.to/2AwseOD"><em>Half of a Yellow Sun</em>:</a> a story about twin sisters, set during the Biafran War in Nigeria.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Twentieth Century and Beyond: Non-Fiction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Roxane Gay, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OtU2G3"><em>Hunger</em>:</a> by turns heartbreaking and enraging, this series of essays considers the difficulties of living in a female body.</p></li>
<li><p>Cordelia Fine, <a href="https://amzn.to/2K6uziD"><em>Delusions of Gender</em>:</a> Fine digs into the science behind gender differences, and argues that we are using unclear science to support, not challenge, ingrained ideas about gender.</p></li>
<li><p>Lauren Winner, <a href="https://amzn.to/2K79CnT"><em>Still: Notes on a Mid-Faith Crisis</em>:</a> this memoir grapples with continuing to trust God when that trust feels impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Kate Bowler, <a href="https://amzn.to/2mTkgW8"><em>Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I&rsquo;ve Loved</em>:</a> suddenly confronted with her own mortality after years researching the prosperity gospel, Bowler meditates on how we live when nothing makes sense anymore.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Twentieth Century and Beyond: Theology and Spirituality</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lynn Cohick, <a href="https://amzn.to/2LLN3tr"><em>Women in the World of the Earliest Christians</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2LOdw9Z"><em>Christian Women in the Patristic World</em></a> (with Amy Brown Hughes): Cohick&rsquo;s histories of women in the early days of the church show both the early involvement of women and the ways in which cultural patriarchy has hindered women&rsquo;s full participation in the church from it earliest days.</p></li>
<li><p>Austin Channing Brown, <a href="https://amzn.to/2AmmMxx"><em>I&rsquo;m Still Here</em>:</a> a call for the church to confront its racism.</p></li>
<li><p>Jen Hatmaker, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kbwq5E"><em>7: An Experimental Mutiny Against Excess</em>:</a> a helpful guide to reducing our consumerism and reprioritizing how we spend our money.</p></li>
</ul>
