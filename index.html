    <div class="body"><p>Happy New Year! I&rsquo;m taking a bit of a break for the holidays and spending time comforting my poor southern daughters, who are struggling with the sub-zero temperatures of the current cold snap. Much snuggling under warm blankets has been necessary (ah, the burdens of parenthood … ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to posting on a regular schedule next Monday, and coming up this month I&rsquo;ll be discussing Oliver Cromwell, the White Witch, Margery Kempe, and my hopes for 2018.</p>

<p>I also have a guest post today on the Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE International) blog, in which I address the argument that husbands are responsible for their wives' sanctification (spoiler: they aren&rsquo;t). Read that piece <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-husbands-cant-get-her-ready-jesus?platform=hootsuite">here</a>, and while you&rsquo;re there check out the other fantastic resources on CBE&rsquo;s website.</p></div>

<p>I meant to put this up yesterday, but I was distracted by Santa&rsquo;s generosity with Dove chocolates, a Christmas nap with a snuggling child, and a family viewing of that holiday classic, <em>The Lego Batman Movie.</em></p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still Christmas — if the second day, not the first. Instead of two calling birds, I give you a poem by the nineteenth-century British poet Christina Rossetti. Her poetry often reflects on the experience of being a woman, and this poem is no exception: she places Mary&rsquo;s simply, physical breastmilk and kiss on the same level as the worship of heavenly beings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bleak Midwinter,&rdquo; Christina Rossetti (via <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53216/in-the-bleak-midwinter">Poetry Foundation</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,</p>

<p>Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;</p>

<p>Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>

<p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;</p>

<p>Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed</p>

<p>The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,</p>

<p>Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,</p>

<p>The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p>

<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,</p>

<p>Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;</p>

<p>But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,</p>

<p>Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.</p>

<p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?</p>

<p>If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;</p>

<p>If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;</p>

<p>Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>May you have a joyous Christmas season, in the promise and hope of Advent and Incarnation.</p></div>

<p><em>The 6th and final part of an Advent series on incarnation. Read the whole series: <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>, and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-18-2017-advent-incarnation-V">part 5</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I write this, I can feel the tickle in the back of my throat that tells me I&rsquo;m about to get an early gift from my four-year-old: her cold. On a larger scale, I am still both physically and emotionally exhausted from ending a career this year that I had though I&rsquo;d be in for the rest of my life and then moving cross-country. I started medication for anxiety a month ago, and I can finally feel the tension beginning to ease out of my shoulders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about how the Incarnation, the first coming of Christ two millennia ago in Bethlehem, teaches us to value physical bodies. After all, if the creator of the universe chose to become a human being and live among human beings, how can we live as though our bodies don&rsquo;t matter, or are hindrances to be overcome?</p>

<p>And yet, having a body sucks.</p>

<p>Our bodies get sick, with colds and cancers and chronic illness. Our bodies get tired and injured. Our bodies age. Our bodies experience the effects of mental illness, of stress, of late nights and early mornings, of difficult relationships and circumstances. Our bodies die.</p>

<p>During Advent, we remember that Christ came as a helpless infant, taking on human flesh and dwelling among us. But we also hope for his return, when we too will be recreated in new bodies free from the effects of sin. For Advent brings with it the promise not just of the coming king but of resurrection, of new birth, of new creation.</p>

<p>Advent is, in part, a time of joy, hope and anticipation — and the ubiquity of Christmas in American culture can often make us feel as though we are somehow deficient if we can&rsquo;t get into the Christmas spirit. No one wants to be an Ebenezer Scrooge at the holidays. But often, the problem is not that our hearts are two sizes too small; the problem is that our hearts are broken and our bodies are weary.</p>

<p>The good news is that Advent, the Incarnation, isn&rsquo;t about Christmas cheer. Oh, celebration is good: Advent is about the joy of God&rsquo;s presence among us. But Advent is also about the longing of God&rsquo;s people for their savior. We long for what we don&rsquo;t yet have, we mourn for the brokenness in the world, we suffer from sin and death and decay.</p>

<p>Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to just be happy. Advent acknowledges our pain and loss and sadness, and says: look, here is hope: hope in the willingness of a teenage girl to become the mother of God, hope in her husband who accepted her despite her pregnancy, hope in the shepherds and wise men who came to bow before the ruler of the universe in the form of a child. Hope that God&rsquo;s kingdom is coming, has come, will one day fully arrive.</p>

<p>But hope only works when life is not as it should be, just as light only makes sense in the darkness. For my readers in the northern hemisphere, today is the shortest day of the year, and Advent is framed by these dark winter weeks. The world is cold and dead, and we remember that we still suffer in sin and darkness; our physical bodies bear the marks of sin and death. But on this, the shortest day of the year, we remember that spring will return. Winter may stay for months, but we know that spring is coming. Life is coming.</p>

<p>Unlike spring, which always arrives, some of us may never experience healing in our bodies in this life. The waiting is much more difficult when we can&rsquo;t count down the days until warmth and life returns. But Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to deny the painful realities of our present lives.</p>

<p>Advent simply asks us to remember that there is hope. Hope in a manger in Bethlehem, hope that Christ will come again, hope in God&rsquo;s ultimate victory over sin and death.</p>

<p>The Incarnation, all those years ago in the body of a teenage girl, tells us that God created us good, values our bodies, mourns with us over the pain these bodies bring. It is also a promise that one day, all will be made whole again, and the effects of sin and evil and death will be removed from our recreated bodies.</p>

<p>In the words of Julian of Norwich, Advent asks us to hope that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.</p>

<p>(For anyone struggling to feel the holiday spirit in 2017, I highly recommend Rachel Held Evans' article <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/unsentimental-advent">&ldquo;Mary, the Magnificat, and an Unsentimental Advent&rdquo;</a>.)</p></div>

<p><em>Part 5 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, or <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>.</em></p>

<p>How do you feel about God today?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awkward question for me to write. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to <em>know</em> about God, not <em>feel</em> about him? Doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9">Jeremiah tell us</a> that the heart is deceitful above all things?</p>

<p>But living in a body means having emotions. Even if we try to deny, suppress or muscle through those emotions, they still exist, often manifesting in physical ways: hunched shoulders, clenched fists, butterflies, tears, laughter, relaxation. If we elevate mind over body, we also elevate mind over emotions — an elevation further exacerbated by the association of emotions with femininity and weakness.</p>

<p>But once again, the Incarnation forces us to think about the whole experience of having bodies: experience which includes emotions. The body incorporates both mind and emotion, and attempts to deny or diminish this ignore the created reality of our physical existence and experience.</p>

<p>Every person, of course, experiences emotions differently (and different cultures understand emotions <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">in different ways</a>). But emotions are a sign of being human, of having the capacity to respond to our world with more than just logic; emotions are a part of the divine image within humanity. Additionally, emotions are not somehow feminine; despite the way modern American culture suppresses men&rsquo;s emotions, men are not less emotional beings that women (and emotion is not feminine weakness).</p>

<p>We see Jesus experience and express emotions during his time on earth: his grief over the death of Lazarus, his weary need to withdraw from the crowds, his anger at the merchants and money-changers in the temple, his gentle exasperation with his disciples for misunderstanding his teachings. And more, we see Jesus experience and address his emotions. He weeps when he grieves and he goes to pray alone when he needs to rest from the demands of the crowd, rather than ignore or suppress his feelings.</p>

<p>I confess that emotions can be difficult for me. I tend to be controlled and reserved; I don&rsquo;t like feeling out of control emotionally, and it often seems safer to tuck emotions away rather than actually acknowledge and deal with them. And more, emotions aren&rsquo;t always a suitable guide for our actions or even a proportionate response to whatever evoked them. In short, emotions are messy, unpredictable, and often illogical.</p>

<p>But emotions can be good, as well. The joy of a child watching the first snow of winter. The upwelling of gratitude for the kindness of a friend. The flutters of love for a significant other. The peace of an ocean sunrise. Even our anger and grief can connect us to others and spur us to action.</p>

<p>The heart may be deceitful; we&rsquo;ve all experienced misleading emotional reactions. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that the heart is somehow more deceitful than the mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18-31">Paul reminds us</a> that the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of the world; human reason alone cannot get us all the way to God any more than human emotion can.</p>

<p>God gives us both reason and emotion, and both have their place. In fallen, sinful human bodies, neither can be wholly trusted — but neither can be wholly dismissed. Emotion can temper our reason, reminding us that real people are affected by the rational arguments that we make on any number of topics. And reason can temper emotion, helping to move us beyond our initial reactions.</p>

<p>When we insist on logic and dismiss emotions as deceptive, we buy into a valuation of body and emotion rooted in Greek philosophy, not God&rsquo;s created reality. This denigration of our emotional selves emerges especially from strains of theology that emphasize orthodoxy (that <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">right mental furniture</a>) over orthopraxy, and from theologies that prize authority over experience. Both tell us to suppress emotions in favor of reason, whether our own or that of an authority figure (or a combination of both). I should note that this is my own tradition; the holiness tradition often goes in the opposite direction, valuing emotion above reason, and both imbalances can be dangerous.</p>

<p>You may also notice, reading this post, that I&rsquo;m trying to use rational argument to show that we should value emotion. Most people, it seems, gravitate to one over the other; I gravitate towards reason (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re shocked to learn). But despite our own tendencies, we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss our emotional selves.</p>

<p>To do so denies our created reality and thus denies the reality of the Incarnation, which placed immeasurable value on our created bodies.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 4 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a> and <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3 here</a></em></p>

<p>Over the last three posts, I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the ramification of the Incarnation — for bodies, for systems of belief, for women. But Advent is about both the already and the not yet: the world in which we live and believe and work and grieve and laugh, and the fully redeemed world for which we hope. Advent asks us to remember that Christ came, as a baby in a stable, and that he will one day come again.</p>

<p>Advent asks us to hold together the past and future, to step for a moment out of the linear time of alarm clocks and shopping days that rules our daily lives. Advent reminds that we are waiting for the coming savior, like Anna and Simeon at the temple, like Elizabeth and Zechariah, like the prophets of old.</p>

<p>And Advent should remind us that when the savior comes, it may not look like we expect.</p>

<p>The Christmas story is so familiar to most of us as to be almost banal. The manger, the shepherds, the wise men — we know the drill. Plus, we&rsquo;re used to the sanitized version, the adorable kids in lamb costumes, the nativities carefully unwrapped from tissue paper. Even if we understand how radical it was for Christ, the creator of the universe, to be born to a humble family in the humblest of circumstances, it can be hard to fully grasp how different this was from how most first-century Jews would have imagined the birth of their savior.</p>

<p>But we should be humbled by this reminder: how might Christ&rsquo;s second coming look different from what we imagine? And I don&rsquo;t just mean different from the predictions of a Harold Camping or Hal Lindsey (or, dare I say, a Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins). If God first came in the humblest possible manner, and proceeded to live a life amongst the poor and oppressed and sinful people of a conquered territory, what does this suggest about his second coming?</p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed, we affirm that Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead — and if we&rsquo;re honest, we either ignore that part (judgment is often unpleasant) or assume that it will apply to others: Christ will judge people who actually deserve it, a group that surely does not include us. I think it&rsquo;s plain old human nature to assume that Jesus will affirm our rightness, or at least extend us grace, while hoping (secretly or not) for him to condemn others.</p>

<p>But the New Testament is full of warnings about judgment: I mentioned the passage in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46">Matthew</a> last week, where Jesus sends away those who did not feed the hungry or clothe the naked because what they did not do &ldquo;to the least of these&rdquo; they did not do to Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7:21-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a> even more clearly states that not everyone who says &ldquo;lord, lord&rdquo; to Jesus will be saved. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+3&amp;version=NIV">1 John 3</a>, the apostle John warns us that if we do not love we are murderers — and that we must love with actions, not just words.</p>

<p>These are uncomfortable passages, especially for us <em>sola fide</em> protestants; they carry the impression that our actions, and not just our mental faith furniture, matter for our salvation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tear down one of the pillars of the Reformation, although I will note that orthodox Christianity in all its forms affirms both truths that only God can save and that our actions here on earth matter. So when we think of Christ returning in glory and judgment, we have to consider our own actions and how they align with the kingdom that Jesus inaugurated with his first coming.</p>

<p>And what does that kingdom look like? What sort of world do we see Jesus pointing towards in his time on earth?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a kingdom of healing, both physical and spiritual. It&rsquo;s a kingdom of grace for sinners. It&rsquo;s a kingdom that has no place for the rich and prideful, for those who jockey for positions of power and authority, for those who place heavy religious burdens on the backs of others. It&rsquo;s a kingdom inherited by the meek, built by the peacemakers, inhabited by the poor in spirit. It&rsquo;s a kingdom where a worker can get a full day&rsquo;s wage for just a few hours of work, where a heartbreaking disappointment of a son is welcomed home with open arms, where each individual matters regardless of their station in life.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the kingdom that Christ inaugurated with his incarnation, death and resurrection, his return will likely also disrupt and upend the systems that seem so natural and right to us today. And so even as we hope and long for Christ&rsquo;s return, we must do so with humility and the sober awareness that we might just be the Romans and the Pharisees rather than the least of these.</p>

<p>This is a challenge for me, to be sure. Tidy categories of right and wrong make judgment much easier to contemplate. And believing the right thing is simpler than doing the right thing. I do believe that sin exists and that beliefs matter. But as I&rsquo;ve discussed in the last several posts, the Incarnation means that we cannot stop at belief; what we do with our bodies in the physical world also matters. As members of the already-and-not-yet kingdom, we will inevitably fail to fully live into the tangible peace and justice and love of that kingdom — but we are to try anyway.</p>

<p>So this Advent season, may we remember Jesus' first coming and look forward to his second. And may we remember that his first coming upended any conventional idea about what it would mean for God to dwell among us, as one of us. Let us not become complacent that our right beliefs will insulate us from judgment, and let us not grow weary in doing good.</p></div>
