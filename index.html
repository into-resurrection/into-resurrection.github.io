<p>I hate New Years resolutions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perfectionist by nature, so when I fail to keep a resolution — as I inevitably do — I feel like a failure and then I toss the resolution and then fail like a failure for tossing the resolution. It&rsquo;s not a particularly healthy cycle, so I&rsquo;ve given myself a pass on the resolutions for the last several years. Besides which, on the academic schedule I&rsquo;ve followed for my entire adult life, August always feels more like the start of a new year. August resolutions aren&rsquo;t really a thing, so I can&rsquo;t fail at those.</p>

<p>But this year, for the first time, my kids are going back to school and I&rsquo;m not. 2017 was a rough year, and I feel the need to regroup and think about what I want to accomplish as I move forward. I&rsquo;m not making resolutions. But I am making goals and giving myself a word for 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop picking up my phone when I wake up. I always intend to just check the weather, but then I check my calendar, and my to-do list, and my email, and once I&rsquo;ve done that I might as well check Facebook, and then Twitter … and then the lunches need to packed and the kids need breakfast and I&rsquo;m still in my pajamas and annoyed about whatever I&rsquo;ve seen on social media. Breakfast of champions, digital edition. I&rsquo;m not sure if I can stay off social media until noon, but I can at least wait until the kids are out the door.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more non-fiction. My non-fiction to-be-read pile is embarrassingly large (my fiction pile is also embarrassingly large, but at least it rotates), and given a choice I almost always pick up the fiction to read. My awesome theology book club is a help here, but in 2018 I want to put a dent in my pile of non-fiction books.</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing my book. I&rsquo;m still processing my life post-academia, but I want to start moving forward. And even though I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what that looks like, with the blog launched I&rsquo;m ready to start working on something bigger.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>My Word:</strong></p>

<p>Three goals, one word for the new year, and that word is SPACE.</p>

<p>A lot happened to me in 2017, and I&rsquo;m still processing much of it. I like results; I like decisions; I don&rsquo;t like uncertainty and waiting. But in 2018, I want to give myself space.</p>

<p>Space to grieve and to heal. Space to try new things, and to fail, and to try again. Space to breathe on bad days, space to be spontaneous and happy on good ones.</p>

<p>Space to fail at my goals, and start again.</p>

<p>Space for old friendships to move into new patterns and space for new friendships to grow.</p>

<p>Space for the Holy Spirit in my life, to listen and learn and grow in my faith.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be seduced by the expectation that a new year will be a better year and by the hope that I will end 2018 as the impossibly perfect version of myself. So I also want to give 2018 space to be hard and unpleasant and full of anger and sadness and failures. But I hope, through all that the year may hold, that I will grow and work and learn and love and hope.</p>

<p>And I pray the same for all of you.</p></div>

    <div class="body"><p>Happy New Year! I&rsquo;m taking a bit of a break for the holidays and spending time comforting my poor southern daughters, who are struggling with the sub-zero temperatures of the current cold snap. Much snuggling under warm blankets has been necessary (ah, the burdens of parenthood … ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to posting on a regular schedule next Monday, and coming up this month I&rsquo;ll be discussing Oliver Cromwell, the White Witch, Margery Kempe, and my hopes for 2018.</p>

<p>I also have a guest post today on the Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE International) blog, in which I address the argument that husbands are responsible for their wives' sanctification (spoiler: they aren&rsquo;t). Read that piece <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-husbands-cant-get-her-ready-jesus?platform=hootsuite">here</a>, and while you&rsquo;re there check out the other fantastic resources on CBE&rsquo;s website.</p></div>

<p>I meant to put this up yesterday, but I was distracted by Santa&rsquo;s generosity with Dove chocolates, a Christmas nap with a snuggling child, and a family viewing of that holiday classic, <em>The Lego Batman Movie.</em></p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still Christmas — if the second day, not the first. Instead of two calling birds, I give you a poem by the nineteenth-century British poet Christina Rossetti. Her poetry often reflects on the experience of being a woman, and this poem is no exception: she places Mary&rsquo;s simply, physical breastmilk and kiss on the same level as the worship of heavenly beings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bleak Midwinter,&rdquo; Christina Rossetti (via <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53216/in-the-bleak-midwinter">Poetry Foundation</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,</p>

<p>Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;</p>

<p>Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>

<p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;</p>

<p>Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed</p>

<p>The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,</p>

<p>Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,</p>

<p>The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p>

<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,</p>

<p>Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;</p>

<p>But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,</p>

<p>Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.</p>

<p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?</p>

<p>If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;</p>

<p>If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;</p>

<p>Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>May you have a joyous Christmas season, in the promise and hope of Advent and Incarnation.</p></div>

<p><em>The 6th and final part of an Advent series on incarnation. Read the whole series: <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>, and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-18-2017-advent-incarnation-V">part 5</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I write this, I can feel the tickle in the back of my throat that tells me I&rsquo;m about to get an early gift from my four-year-old: her cold. On a larger scale, I am still both physically and emotionally exhausted from ending a career this year that I had though I&rsquo;d be in for the rest of my life and then moving cross-country. I started medication for anxiety a month ago, and I can finally feel the tension beginning to ease out of my shoulders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about how the Incarnation, the first coming of Christ two millennia ago in Bethlehem, teaches us to value physical bodies. After all, if the creator of the universe chose to become a human being and live among human beings, how can we live as though our bodies don&rsquo;t matter, or are hindrances to be overcome?</p>

<p>And yet, having a body sucks.</p>

<p>Our bodies get sick, with colds and cancers and chronic illness. Our bodies get tired and injured. Our bodies age. Our bodies experience the effects of mental illness, of stress, of late nights and early mornings, of difficult relationships and circumstances. Our bodies die.</p>

<p>During Advent, we remember that Christ came as a helpless infant, taking on human flesh and dwelling among us. But we also hope for his return, when we too will be recreated in new bodies free from the effects of sin. For Advent brings with it the promise not just of the coming king but of resurrection, of new birth, of new creation.</p>

<p>Advent is, in part, a time of joy, hope and anticipation — and the ubiquity of Christmas in American culture can often make us feel as though we are somehow deficient if we can&rsquo;t get into the Christmas spirit. No one wants to be an Ebenezer Scrooge at the holidays. But often, the problem is not that our hearts are two sizes too small; the problem is that our hearts are broken and our bodies are weary.</p>

<p>The good news is that Advent, the Incarnation, isn&rsquo;t about Christmas cheer. Oh, celebration is good: Advent is about the joy of God&rsquo;s presence among us. But Advent is also about the longing of God&rsquo;s people for their savior. We long for what we don&rsquo;t yet have, we mourn for the brokenness in the world, we suffer from sin and death and decay.</p>

<p>Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to just be happy. Advent acknowledges our pain and loss and sadness, and says: look, here is hope: hope in the willingness of a teenage girl to become the mother of God, hope in her husband who accepted her despite her pregnancy, hope in the shepherds and wise men who came to bow before the ruler of the universe in the form of a child. Hope that God&rsquo;s kingdom is coming, has come, will one day fully arrive.</p>

<p>But hope only works when life is not as it should be, just as light only makes sense in the darkness. For my readers in the northern hemisphere, today is the shortest day of the year, and Advent is framed by these dark winter weeks. The world is cold and dead, and we remember that we still suffer in sin and darkness; our physical bodies bear the marks of sin and death. But on this, the shortest day of the year, we remember that spring will return. Winter may stay for months, but we know that spring is coming. Life is coming.</p>

<p>Unlike spring, which always arrives, some of us may never experience healing in our bodies in this life. The waiting is much more difficult when we can&rsquo;t count down the days until warmth and life returns. But Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to deny the painful realities of our present lives.</p>

<p>Advent simply asks us to remember that there is hope. Hope in a manger in Bethlehem, hope that Christ will come again, hope in God&rsquo;s ultimate victory over sin and death.</p>

<p>The Incarnation, all those years ago in the body of a teenage girl, tells us that God created us good, values our bodies, mourns with us over the pain these bodies bring. It is also a promise that one day, all will be made whole again, and the effects of sin and evil and death will be removed from our recreated bodies.</p>

<p>In the words of Julian of Norwich, Advent asks us to hope that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.</p>

<p>(For anyone struggling to feel the holiday spirit in 2017, I highly recommend Rachel Held Evans' article <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/unsentimental-advent">&ldquo;Mary, the Magnificat, and an Unsentimental Advent&rdquo;</a>.)</p></div>

<p><em>Part 5 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, or <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>.</em></p>

<p>How do you feel about God today?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awkward question for me to write. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to <em>know</em> about God, not <em>feel</em> about him? Doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9">Jeremiah tell us</a> that the heart is deceitful above all things?</p>

<p>But living in a body means having emotions. Even if we try to deny, suppress or muscle through those emotions, they still exist, often manifesting in physical ways: hunched shoulders, clenched fists, butterflies, tears, laughter, relaxation. If we elevate mind over body, we also elevate mind over emotions — an elevation further exacerbated by the association of emotions with femininity and weakness.</p>

<p>But once again, the Incarnation forces us to think about the whole experience of having bodies: experience which includes emotions. The body incorporates both mind and emotion, and attempts to deny or diminish this ignore the created reality of our physical existence and experience.</p>

<p>Every person, of course, experiences emotions differently (and different cultures understand emotions <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">in different ways</a>). But emotions are a sign of being human, of having the capacity to respond to our world with more than just logic; emotions are a part of the divine image within humanity. Additionally, emotions are not somehow feminine; despite the way modern American culture suppresses men&rsquo;s emotions, men are not less emotional beings that women (and emotion is not feminine weakness).</p>

<p>We see Jesus experience and express emotions during his time on earth: his grief over the death of Lazarus, his weary need to withdraw from the crowds, his anger at the merchants and money-changers in the temple, his gentle exasperation with his disciples for misunderstanding his teachings. And more, we see Jesus experience and address his emotions. He weeps when he grieves and he goes to pray alone when he needs to rest from the demands of the crowd, rather than ignore or suppress his feelings.</p>

<p>I confess that emotions can be difficult for me. I tend to be controlled and reserved; I don&rsquo;t like feeling out of control emotionally, and it often seems safer to tuck emotions away rather than actually acknowledge and deal with them. And more, emotions aren&rsquo;t always a suitable guide for our actions or even a proportionate response to whatever evoked them. In short, emotions are messy, unpredictable, and often illogical.</p>

<p>But emotions can be good, as well. The joy of a child watching the first snow of winter. The upwelling of gratitude for the kindness of a friend. The flutters of love for a significant other. The peace of an ocean sunrise. Even our anger and grief can connect us to others and spur us to action.</p>

<p>The heart may be deceitful; we&rsquo;ve all experienced misleading emotional reactions. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that the heart is somehow more deceitful than the mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18-31">Paul reminds us</a> that the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of the world; human reason alone cannot get us all the way to God any more than human emotion can.</p>

<p>God gives us both reason and emotion, and both have their place. In fallen, sinful human bodies, neither can be wholly trusted — but neither can be wholly dismissed. Emotion can temper our reason, reminding us that real people are affected by the rational arguments that we make on any number of topics. And reason can temper emotion, helping to move us beyond our initial reactions.</p>

<p>When we insist on logic and dismiss emotions as deceptive, we buy into a valuation of body and emotion rooted in Greek philosophy, not God&rsquo;s created reality. This denigration of our emotional selves emerges especially from strains of theology that emphasize orthodoxy (that <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">right mental furniture</a>) over orthopraxy, and from theologies that prize authority over experience. Both tell us to suppress emotions in favor of reason, whether our own or that of an authority figure (or a combination of both). I should note that this is my own tradition; the holiness tradition often goes in the opposite direction, valuing emotion above reason, and both imbalances can be dangerous.</p>

<p>You may also notice, reading this post, that I&rsquo;m trying to use rational argument to show that we should value emotion. Most people, it seems, gravitate to one over the other; I gravitate towards reason (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re shocked to learn). But despite our own tendencies, we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss our emotional selves.</p>

<p>To do so denies our created reality and thus denies the reality of the Incarnation, which placed immeasurable value on our created bodies.</p></div>
