<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a sermon on guns or gun violence.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in God and guns sort of churches (or attended chapel at Liberty University), where I might have been more likely to hear something about guns. But pretty much everywhere in America, guns are a touchy issue due to both the Second Amendment and a culture that glorifies guns and gun violence. It&rsquo;s not surprising that few pastors want to venture into this particular minefield. And yet, as Christians, we need to learn to think theologically about guns.</p>

<p>The political issue of gun control is large and complex, and further complicated by the sheer number of guns in the United States — nearly 90 guns for every 100 people. I&rsquo;m not going to tackle the practical or political side of this issue today, although for those interested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html">Nicholas Kristof&rsquo;s Nov. 6 opinion piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> makes a number of reasonable suggestions. Instead, I want to challenge us as Christians to do a better job of thinking theologically about gun violence. Even when we disagree about gun policies, we Christians can and should have a thoughtful theological grounding as we approach this topic.</p>

<p>The cornerstone for any theology of violence is, obviously, the conviction that life matters, that all humans are created in the image of God and that God cares for each human life — and expects us as Christians to do likewise. But this belief is so broad as to be almost meaningless; it vanishes into arguments about just war or self defense, or claims that the perpetrators of gun violence are mentally ill and thus incapable of moral reasoning. We may all agree that life is valuable, but this belief hasn&rsquo;t forced Christians to confront our own complicity in a culture that glorifies guns and turns a blind eye to the consequences of that glorification.</p>

<p>So we need something beyond valuing life to undergird a theology of guns. I want to suggest three ways to approach this theology: first, understanding the transformation of weapons into life-giving tools in the coming kingdom of God; second, resisting the impulse to fear; and third, rejecting the glorification of guns and gun violence.</p>

<p>Two different prophets in the Old Testament — <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+2:4&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+4:3&amp;version=NIV">Micah</a> — use the image of swords being beaten into plowshares as they describe the coming kingdom of God, a time when God reigns on earth with justice and peace and when war no longer exists. This image of swords and plows not only removes the need for weapons but flips their purpose, transforming tools that bring death into tools that bring life. Further, when Jesus is betrayed and arrested, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26:47-56&amp;version=NIV">he tells Peter</a> that his kingdom will not be inaugurated by a violent conquest but instead by his own submission to violence.</p>

<p>Christians have certainly had many disagreements over centuries about what these passages, and others, mean for our lives. I think a strong case can be made for Christian pacifism, although arguments about just war that allow Christians to use violence in certain situations are, and historically have been, widely accepted in the church. But regardless of our own convictions the use of violence, we must understand that we are longing for a kingdom in which violence has no place, in which we nourish life rather than mete out death. Many Christians see violence as necessary in a fallen world, but we should always approach violence soberly, in the knowledge that it is a product of our sin.</p>

<p>What does this approach to violence mean for a theology of guns? Guns are like swords: their purpose is to kill. They exist to bring death, not life, even if many gun owners never use them outside a firing range. Christians are people of new life, not death, and this conviction should underly our attitude towards guns. On a practical level, Christians should be the most responsible gun owners and should be wary of the proliferation of guns. Guns won&rsquo;t ever be anything other than tools of death, but they can be made safer, harder to obtain, and rarer.</p>

<p>My second approach builds on the first: as Christians, we must reject the culture of fear that encourages gun ownership. One of the most common commands in scripture is &ldquo;fear not&rdquo;: not even death can harm us now that we are in Christ. But fear often spurs gun sales, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/gun-sales-mass-shooting/541809/">now-predictable spike in gun sales</a> that follows mass shootings. The fears vary — of another shooting, of tightened regulations — but the result is more guns and more fear. Christians can reasonably disagree about the use of violence, but we must be vigilant about being manipulated by manufactured fears.</p>

<p>Living in fear leads to distrust and isolation. With the gun issue, we distrust anyone on the opposite side, assuming that they want to leave us vulnerable to harm (which may mean too many or too few guns, depending on the point of view). Brené Brown wrote a wonderful <a href="http://brenebrown.com/blog/2017/11/08/gun-reform-speaking-truth-bullshit-practicing-civility-affecting-change/">article</a> on, among other things, the way we demonize the opposite side in this debate; I would add that our tendency to polarize on this issue arises from fear. In one of his epistles, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&amp;version=NIV">John writes that</a> &ldquo;the one who fears is not made perfect in love.&rdquo; Love leaves no room for fear, but the converse is also true: fear makes love difficult. A culture that encourages us to fear the other (whoever that may be) is incompatible with a culture that tells us to love one another.</p>

<p>For our theology of guns, this means that Christians must guard against fear as a motivation for owning guns. But more than this, we cannot allow fear to poison our relationships with other Christians with whom we disagree. Fear and distrust prevent constructive conversations about guns and gun violence, and Christians should be able to set an example for reasonable, productive dialogue.</p>

<p>Finally, my third approach for a theology of guns requires that we reject the glorification of guns and gun violence. As Americans, we are all complicit in the celebration of violence that permeates our culture, from films to music to sports (and even <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jesus-throw-punches-fight-church-christian-ministries-fight/story?id=25953786">churches</a>). And while the problem of celebrating violence is larger than guns, Clint Eastwood and James Bond demonstrate that guns are often associated with strength and sexual attractiveness. The good guy with a gun is an almost mythic figure revered in American society.</p>

<p>But time and again in scripture, God rejects the glorification of violence and the idolization of the hero. In the Old Testament, God uses the small, the weak, and  the inexperienced to defeat the powerful: David and Goliath, Gideon&rsquo;s tiny army, Jael&rsquo;s defeat of Sisera. And in the New Testament, neither Jesus nor the apostles ever encourage violence as a way of life, as a method of bringing about God&rsquo;s kingdom. Jesus says that the meek and the peacemakers are blessed, not the warriors. Power, physical and otherwise, may be prized by the world, but the kingdom of God subverts these values and exalts the weak instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians should never enjoy a war film or a Bond movie, take a self defense course or serve in the military. But we need to turn a critical eye on violence in American culture and resist the tendency to admire violence. This means swimming upstream against the currents of most human history; modern-day America is hardly unique in its glorification of violence. When it comes to guns, we need to look hard at our motivations: do we intend to use them as tools, albeit deadly ones, or are they accessories to our own ideals of self-reliance, strength or sexiness? Because the latter does not track with the virtues Christians are supposed to cultivate.</p>

<p>The three approaches I&rsquo;ve outlines above are meant as a starting point, not a final word, for a theological framework for guns. All three points can be expanded and their implications on gun policy debated. But gun debates tend to devolve into arguments about safety on the one hand and the Second Amendment on the other. Neither is the right starting point for Christians, and frankly neither addresses the very real legal and social complexities of gun ownership in America. As Christians, we should have a third way, a theological way, of addressing this issue.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all Christians will agree on gun policies. But it should mean that we can approach this topic not out of fear or defensiveness, but in the spirit of peace and charity. In particular, we must remember that guns are tools of death that may be necessary evils now but that we trust will one day be unnecessary. This knowledge combined with a resistance to both fear-mongering and the glorification of gun violence will lay a foundation for real discussions of what gun ownership should look like in America.</p>

<p>Because we live in the hope of a coming kingdom of peace and justice, Christians have every reason to set the tone for this discussion. It&rsquo;s time we step up, regardless of our side on the issue, and do so.</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/11-01-2017-500-years-reformation">Martin Luther</a> and the protestant Reformation, so it seems appropriate this week to consider a woman who was crucial to the Reformation in England. Elizabeth I may not be an obvious choice for a series on theology, but her personal convictions and political astuteness laid the foundation for today&rsquo;s global Anglican Communion.</p>

<p>To understand Elizabeth&rsquo;s role in the English Reformation, we need a short(ish) history lesson. Elizabeth&rsquo;s father was Henry VIII, most famous for his many wives and king of England in the early sixteenth century, as the Reformation was gathering steam in Germany, Switzerland and the the Netherlands. However, Henry was not interested in the ideas of the reformers; in fact, he wrote<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a treatise defending the seven sacraments in response to Martin Luther&rsquo;s attack on indulgences. For this work, and for his continued support of the papacy, pope Leo X named Henry Defender of the Faith in 1521.</p>

<p>And yet, in a plot twist still fit for modern television, Henry grew enamored with the young Anne Boleyn. His wife, Catherine of Aragon, was past the age of childbearing and had not managed to produce a male heir despite seven pregnancies.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> So Henry sought what many heirless nobles before him had acquired: an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.</p>

<p>Catherine, however, was a well-connected and strong-willed woman. Her parents were Ferdinand and Isabella of Christopher Columbus fame; her siblings unified Spain through strategic marriages; her nephew Charles V ruled the Holy Roman Empire. She was loath to give up her position as queen of England, and it seems that Charles V pressured the pope on her behalf to deny the annulment. While the politics and motivations of Henry, Catherine and the pope are complex, the result was not: Henry was not granted his annulment.</p>

<p>When Henry VIII tired of waiting the pope to dissolve his marriage to Catherine (and when Anne Boleyn gave birth to his daughter, Elizabeth), he began a two-year process that culminated in the Acts of Supremacy of 1534, in which parliament declared Henry the head of the church in England. Henry himself seems to have imagined this new church as theologically identical to the Catholic church, just without the pope. However, many of the architects of the Acts of Supremacy were reformers deeply influenced by Luther. Their influence with Henry was tenuous, but upon his death in 1547 many of these reformers — including Thomas Cranmer, architect of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> — became principle advisors to the young Edward VI.</p>

<p>Edward VI was the son of Henry&rsquo;s third wife, Jane Seymour (she succeeded Anne Boleyn, after Anne&rsquo;s execution); he thus grew up protestant and seems to have been genuinely enthusiastic about supporting the English reformers as they guided the nascent Anglican church in a more reformed direction. However, he was frequently ill and died in 1553 at the age of fifteen, at which time he was succeeded on the throne by his older sister, Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry&rsquo;s first wife, Catherine of Aragon.</p>

<p>This Mary, of course, is Bloody Mary: she violently and swiftly returned England to the Catholicism she had refused to give up. After Henry divorced Catherine, he forced the teenaged Mary to stay in London and would not let her see her mother, even when Catherine was dying. Yet Mary refused to give up her Catholic faith, even when pressured by first Henry and later Edward. Although Edward and his advisors worked frantically to prevent Mary from taking the throne, her legal standing in the line of succession and her popular support meant that she succeeded Edward.</p>

<p>After taking the English throne, Mary wedded Philip of Spain, the son of her cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Spain was emerging as the most powerful defender of Catholicism in Europe, so this alliance solidified Mary&rsquo;s intention to keep England firmly in the Catholic fold. Unfortunately for Mary and English Catholics, she died in 1558, leaving no heir but her half-sister Elizabeth — Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s daughter whose imminent birth (and the hope that she would be a son) had launched Henry on the path of defying Rome.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came to the throne of England in 1558 at the age of 25. England was in turmoil after the rapid shifts from Catholic to protestant to Catholic and back again, not to mention the turmoil always caused by short reigns and disputes over succession. In addition, as a woman Elizabeth faced significant challenges: the early modern period saw the reemergence of the ancient Greek notion that it was inappropriate for women to participate in the public sphere of politics.  Elizabeth thus had to contend with arguments like that published by John Knox in 1558, titled <em>The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</em>. Knox attacked Catholic women monarchs, especially Mary, but built a broader argument against the rule of women in general.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>In short, Elizabeth faced a political challenge: how could she assert her authority in acceptable ways, especially as the head of the Anglican church, and bring peace and unity to England?</p>

<p>By all accounts, Elizabeth succeeded brilliantly over the course of her long and prosperous reign. Her letters and speeches provide a master course in wielding power as an early modern woman. But for the Church of England specifically, Elizabeth&rsquo;s commitment to peace and wide latitude for differing beliefs laid a distinctive foundation for Anglicanism.</p>

<p>After the disruption caused by Mary&rsquo;s reign, Elizabeth envisioned an English church that could encompass all but the most dedicated Catholics and fervent reformers.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> This middle way, or <em>via media</em>, allowed for the continuation of some Catholic elements, like vestments, even as the services (following protestant theology) were conducted in English and the number of sacraments reduced from seven to two. Broadly, this middle way means that Anglican churches even today balance word and sacrament in their services: while Catholic masses tend to emphasize the eucharist (sacrament) and protestant services highlight the sermon (the word), most Anglican services seek to give equal emphasis to both.</p>

<p>In addition to the elements of worship services, Elizabeth&rsquo;s <em>via media</em> also allows for wide latitude in theological beliefs. The foundational theological text of Anglicanism is <em>The Thirty-Nine Articles,</em> which is clearly informed by protestant theology as it among other things permits priests to marry and rejects the idea of Purgatory. Yet <em>The Thirty-Nine Articles</em> allows for a range of beliefs about predestination, for example, and the nature of baptism and the eucharist.</p>

<p>Perhaps more important for the <em>via media</em> than either a mix of worship elements or a flexible theology is the <em>Book of Common Prayer.</em> Elizabeth&rsquo;s 1559 Act of Uniformity required all English churches to use the <em>Book of Common Prayer,</em> which meant that regardless of theological disagreements all English Christians worshipped together with the same prayers and rites. This unity in prayer powerfully bridges divisions in theology, even in today&rsquo;s Anglican Communion. Thus in both ritual and theology, Elizabeth envisioned and created an Anglican church that could unify England.</p>

<p>Without Elizabeth&rsquo;s commitment to peace and unity, and her able statesmanship, England could have collapsed into the religious warfare that rocked Europe in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Of course, England did become embroiled in a civil war with religious underpinnings forty years after Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, but that was due as much to the attempts of James I and Charles I to assert absolute sovereignty as to religious differences.</p>

<p>As a woman, Elizabeth could not attempt to assert absolute power; instead, she had to rule with careful political negotiations and a self-effacing humility. But these qualities endeared her to her people during her long reign and allowed her to heal the fractures of the short reigns and religious shifts that preceded her. She succeeded in uniting English Christians around a flexible protestant theology and, perhaps most importantly, a single prayer book that shaped how generations of Christians have prayed and lived.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not the sole architect of the Anglican church, but without her wise and careful political guidance it surely would not have grown into one of the largest Christian denominations, with 85 million members worldwide. Because she was a woman and a politician, rather than a theologian, her contribution to the formation of the Anglican church is often left to historians. But she deserves to be honored for her wise governance that allowed the English church to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>This past week has been an exciting one in my house, as my middle daughter was baptized and we had the joy of celebrating with many family members.</p>

<p>However, houseguests and other obligations mean a break on the blog today and a schedule change for the rest of 2017. Instead of posting three times a week, I&rsquo;m scaling back to twice. New posts will go up on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Thanks to all for reading!</p></div>

<p>When I was a teenager in a dispensational evangelical church, I had a guilty secret: I didn&rsquo;t really want the Rapture to happen. Definitely not before I had been kissed by a boy, and preferably not before I&rsquo;d had sex. I always felt guilty about my lack of enthusiasm for the return of Christ. I did love Jesus; I just didn&rsquo;t see much appeal in his return, the destruction of the earth, and a blissful but marriage-less existence in heaven.</p>

<p>Both age and moving away from dispensationalism changed this for me. Simply having more life experience, more awareness of the sin and brokenness in the world, made me more aware of our need for Christ&rsquo;s return. And N.T. Wright&rsquo;s vision of the kingdom of God, a place in which justice and mercy abound and all wrongs are made right, gave me a more profound and attractive picture of what happens when Jesus brings about his kingdom.</p>

<p>In my new understanding of the kingdom, I also see God&rsquo;s kingdom as something I&rsquo;m working towards, not simply waiting for. Not in the sense that I have to earn it, but in the sense that my efforts towards peace, justice, reconciliation, mercy, and love — no matter how imperfect — bring a foretaste of God&rsquo;s kingdom and will, somehow, remain part of the kingdom when it arrives in fullness.</p>

<p>But at this point, I image that my readers are wondering if I&rsquo;ve put the wrong title on this blog post: what does this kingdom of Christ have to do with outrage culture and charity?</p>

<p>For those of us in the United States, we&rsquo;ve seen the rise of outrage culture over the last several years, exacerbated by last year&rsquo;s presidential election. The 24-hour news cycle and the immediacy of social media fuel outrage on both the left and the right about any number of events or ideas. The outrage is often manufactured, although the injustices and evils are often real. And for those of us who long for Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and who want to work towards the peace, justice and reconciliation of that kingdom, it can be hard not to get caught up in the outrage.</p>

<p>And outrage and anger aren&rsquo;t always wrong responses to injustice in the world. Anger can alert us that something is not right, that injustice or oppression or violence is occurring; anger is a natural response to the wrongness of evil in the world. But anger is also exhausting and unsustainable. This exhaustion is exacerbated by the cycle in which we&rsquo;re distracted from our anger by something new to be angry about. We end up jaded and cynical, caught in the outrage cycle without an exit.</p>

<p>And so we stew in anger that grows into bitterness, cynicism or a feeling of profound helplessness in the face of so much evil in the world. We end up numb to the injustices that once made us angry.</p>

<p>So the question arises: how can we keep a tender heart towards the injustices and evils in the world without burning out on anger and outrage? Because as Christians who long for the coming of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and who believe that we are to work towards that kingdom, we can&rsquo;t ignore the evil in the world. We can&rsquo;t sit back and wait for it all to burn, or for Jesus to rescue us; we are to be Christ in the world, to feed the hungry and comfort the hurting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have easy steps to avoid outrage, but I have one suggestion: practice charity.</p>

<p>Not the donating used clothing sort of charity, but the charity of faith, hope and charity — the charity that is profound love. Outrage culture thrives when we have an &ldquo;Other&rdquo; to rage against — someone or some group that represents everything that is wrong with the world. Charity approaches that &ldquo;Other&rdquo; as a beloved child of God. Maybe a deeply misguided or even abusive child of God, but a child of God nonetheless. Remember that our struggle is not against people but against powers, and that we are to love our enemies just as we love our friends.</p>

<p>Responding to outrage with charity doesn&rsquo;t mean that we ignore injustices; charity doesn&rsquo;t ask us to pretend that evil doesn&rsquo;t matter. But charity gives the nameless other a face and an identity: child of God. This charity towards others will inevitably temper our outrage. It takes work to see those with whom we disagree as worthy of God&rsquo;s love and ours, but this work is necessary if we want to be free from the cycles of outrage. To be clear, we may still be angry, and rightfully so, because of different events or actions; we will still work against evil. But we can&rsquo;t sustain both outrage and charity, and it is clear which one Jesus calls us towards.</p>

<p>Above all, we must remember that even as we work in the already-but-not-yet kingdom of God, we rely on God, not ourselves, to ultimately redeem the world. We may have reason for anger, but we have no reason for hopelessness. Our labor will not be in vain, even when it seems we make little headway against the evils of the present age. Outrage is an easy but shallow response to the wrongs we see around us. Faith, hope and charity are harder — but better by far.</p></div>

<p>500 years ago yesterday, according to tradition,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenburg, Germany, launching the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p>I always feel a little bit ambivalent about the Reformation. On the one hand, I am a protestant with no intention of crossing the Tiber; I have great respect for Catholic theology, but I align more closely with protestant theology. On the other hand, as an academic medievalist and professional cranky person about historical ignorance, I believe it&rsquo;s important to understand Luther in his context, not as the lone savior of Christianity. Luther&rsquo;s successful schism with the Catholic church was a product of broad cultural and political forces; understanding these forces helps us to better appreciate what Luther launched and to consider what it means to talk about the body of Christ five hundred years after the Reformation.</p>

<p>Growing up protestant (of the non-denominational evangelical variety), the common narrative about the Reformation was that True Christianity™️ had somehow disappeared for at least a millennium before it was revived by the reformers. When it disappeared was a bit vague — with Constantine? The fall of Rome? But its reappearance was easy to identify: Martin Luther and the 95 Theses nailed to the door of the Wittenburg church.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But like all narratives, this one simplifies history in order to focus on only one figure, who comes across as extraordinary. In reality, Luther was part of a much larger push towards reform, and his theology gained a significant boost from the political situation in the Holy Roman Empire (which at the time included much of modern-day Germany).</p>

<p>The idea that the church was essentially dead through the middle ages would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t common, and I address broad misconceptions about the middle ages, including the medieval church, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">here</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-06-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">here.</a> But more specific to the Reformation, the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries — Luther&rsquo;s time period — saw an increase in lay spiritual practices and efforts to reform corruption and theological abuse in the Roman church. Corruption was indeed rampant in the church during this period, particularly in various popes' involvement with the politics of Italian city-states and the Holy Roman Empire. Popes like Julius II used warfare to expand their lands and accumulated vast amounts of wealth in less than ethical ways.</p>

<p>Although open warfare led by the pope was thankfully rare, the drive to increase the papacy&rsquo;s wealth lead to an increase in the sale of indulgences, which became a key point of contention for many reformers both protestant and catholic. The idea of an indulgence for sin has long precedent in Catholic theology, but in the early sixteenth century indulgences were sold to raise money for large-scale building projects and expensive art. The money to pay Michelangelo for the Sistine Chapel, for example, came in large part from the sale of indulgences. Church officials living luxuriously while demanding money from their parishioners are a perennial problem, but were an especially acute one on the eve of the Reformation.</p>

<p>However, even as many in church leadership were more concerned with earthly power and wealth than the care of souls, the growing middle class in Europe eagerly sought opportunities for spiritual growth. More people had basic literacy and the time for devotion, leading to widespread interest in spirituality across Europe — and widespread concern about the corruption in the church. After all, reform arises most effectively from groups who genuinely care about the health of the institution they seek to reform, and the Reformation is no exception.</p>

<p>Moreover, renaissance humanism was spreading across Europe. This was primarily a system of education with a strong emphasis on Greek literature and an equally strong sense of distance from, and recovery of, the classical past. (This sense of rupture from the past differs from the medieval sense of continuity with the Latin past.) The shifting attitudes of renaissance humanism meant a greater willingness to question authority and a larger emphasis on the individual conscience, laying the foundation for several centuries of disruption to the old accepted orders of both religion and politics.</p>

<p>So in the early sixteenth century, we see the convergence of corruption in church leadership with vibrant interest in spiritual growth and with an educational program willing to question tradition. In this environment, the question of reform is not if, but when and how. And here again, Luther may be retrospectively the most dramatic reformer, but he was hardly alone in his criticisms of the church. Three years before Luther&rsquo;s Theses, for example, the scholar Erasmus published (anonymously) a blistering satire about Julius II, self-explanatorily titled <em>Julius Excluded from Heaven.</em> Moreover, Luther&rsquo;s 95 Theses weren&rsquo;t meant to be a dramatic exit from the church but rather an opening salvo in a dialogue aimed at reform.</p>

<p>However, Luther&rsquo;s theses did challenge the authority of the pope and were thus poorly received by church leaders in Germany and Rome, beginning the road towards Luther&rsquo;s excommunication and the establishment of the Lutheran church. The political situation in Germany aided this process; because of the pope&rsquo;s involvement with the Holy Roman Emperor, many German princes within the Holy Roman Empire were happy to find a new way to oppose their emperor and stop the flow of land and money to the church. Some German princes who became Lutheran certainly had a genuine interest in Luther&rsquo;s theology, but the spread of Lutheranism owed much to its political usefulness at this particular moment in time in the German provinces of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>None of this undermines the importance of Luther, or of the Reformation. But as we protestants celebrate the birth of our movement, we should remember that protestants didn&rsquo;t rediscover Christianity, or succeed in separating their churches from national politics and the corruption that follows. (The only Christians advocating the separation of church and state in the sixteenth century were the anabaptists, and if the Lutherans, Calvinists and Catholics could agree on one thing, it was that the anabaptists were the worst.)</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s also worth pausing on the title &ldquo;Reformation,&rdquo; because what happened wasn&rsquo;t a reformation, but a schism. Those reformers who remained Catholic successfully ended many abuses of the leadership, but the damage was already done and the western church had split into factions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As a modern western protestant in a democratic nation that highly values individualism, I sympathize with those who form their own churches based on doctrinal convictions. But I also wonder what we lose when we choose to separate rather than do the hard work of re-learning how to live together.</p>

<p>In the last few years, Lutherans and Catholics have joined together to celebrate the anniversary of the Reformation. These joint celebrations serve as examples of how we can work together as Christians across denomination lines, remembering that above all we are the body of Christ despite the disagreements that inevitably arise in any family.</p>

<p>Luther almost certainly sent his document to the Archbishop of Mainz on this date, who forwarded the theses to Rome on the suspicion of heresy.
