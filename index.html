<p>When I was 20 and spending a year studying in Oxford, I had a crisis of faith.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since realized that my experience was hardly unique; I was in a new environment, exposed to new ideas and people, figuring out who I was and who I could be in the world. Reevaluating my relationship to Christianity seems, in retrospect, perfectly normal in those circumstances.</p>

<p>But at the time, I experienced quite a bit of distress. (I was also, I now realize, in the middle of a major depressive episode which certainly amplified my emotions around my faith.) I wrestled with what I believed; I even tried not believing in God. My thoughts and emotions were a tangled mess and I didn&rsquo;t know what I should believe.</p>

<p>I was in this state when, in late April, I finished my program at Oxford and set off to backpack through Europe. As I travelled, I sat in beautiful churches in every city I visited. Ancient churches, famous churches, small churches, one in Barcelona whose name I&rsquo;ve forgotten but whose stone cloisters contrasted beautifully with the brilliant green trees.</p>

<p>And in those churches, I met God. Not intellectually. Not through scripture or sermons. Not even in answers to the questions I&rsquo;d been asking for months. Instead, in the deep peace of those buildings where saints had worshipped for centuries, I felt God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s peace.</p>

<p>Meeting God in this way moved me profoundly and has anchored me over the years as I continue to wrestle with what it means to be a Christian. But meeting God in this way, in an inexplicable sense of peace and presence, also startled me. In the evangelical (and dispensational) churches of my childhood, faith was primarily intellectual, a matter of believing the right things about God; attending a Christian liberal arts college did little to challenge this approach to faith.</p>

<p>(Plus which, I had absorbed the idea that it was better to be rational than emotional; especially as a woman, I strove to be intellectual rather than driven by feelings. Yay for false dichotomies and internalized misogyny.)</p>

<p>This suprarational experience of feeling God&rsquo;s presence and peace during those weeks of backpacking has shaped my faith ever since. My eyes opened to an entirely new way of knowing God: I still value intellectual knowledge, but adding experiential and mystical knowledge helps me remember that faith is about knowing God, not knowing all the answers.</p>

<p>This may seem like an odd preamble to a post about Julian of Norwich. But she is one of my favorite mystics (let&rsquo;s be honest, my favorite mystic), and I love her in part because she holds together mystical and intellectual knowledge. When she was 30 and deathly ill, she had a series of visions. She recovered, and spent years afterwards writing theological analysis of those visions.</p>

<p>Julian, living in pre-modern England, did not separate intellectual and mystical knowledge of God in the way that we, living in a post-Enlightenment world, so often do. For her, and for many other medieval mystics, mystic theology and scholastic (intellectual) theology were two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Julian&rsquo;s <em>Revelations</em> are theologically dense and intellectually rigorous expositions of her singular mystical experience. Unlike other mystics of her era, Julian only had the one vision — and although we don&rsquo;t know exactly when she finished her <em>Revelations</em> or even when she died, we do know that she lived for many years after her visions and all of her surviving writing is a theological framework for and extrapolation of her vision.</p>

<p>There are many other fascinating aspects of Julian&rsquo;s life — for example, she was an anchoress, a woman who chose to live a monastic life in a tiny, door-less room build onto the side of a church. From this room, Julian could look into the church to see the mass and receive the Eucharist; she could also talk out of her window to townspeople and even tourists who came to her for spiritual advice.</p>

<p>And her theology is fascinating as well: she emphasizes, over and over, God&rsquo;s love for creation, love that continues in the midst of sin and suffering and evil. Julian&rsquo;s famous phrase — &ldquo;All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well&rdquo; — is a profound affirmation that God will, out of love, restore all things and make all things new.</p>

<p>Julian also uses beautiful feminine language to describe God as a loving, nurturing mother. She is not the only medieval mystic to write about God as mother, but the picture of God that emerges from her <em>Revelations</em> is one that highlights God as one who nurtures and loves unconditionally.</p>

<p>Primarily, though, I came to love Julian because she gave me a language and a theological framework that bring together my experience of God and my cerebral theology. She reminds me that we know God in our hearts and our minds, our bodies and our thoughts — and that when intellectual approaches to our faith fall short, God can still be present with us.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The definitive scholarly edition of Julian&rsquo;s works (in Middle English) is <em>The Works of Julian of Norwich</em>, edited by Jacqueline Jenkins and Nicholas Watson. For another Middle English edition geared towards students with extensive notes and a useful glossary, see the TEAMS volume <a href="https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/publication/crampton-shewings-of-julian-norwich"><em>The Shewings of Julian of Norwich</em>,</a> which has the added benefit of being available for free online.</p></li>
<li><p>While there are many translations of Julian&rsquo;s works, I recommend either the translation by Elizabeth Spearing (Penguin Classics) or Barry Windeatt (Oxford World Classics). These are inexpensive translations made by highly respected scholars of Middle English.</p></li>
<li><p>Veronica Mary Rolf&rsquo;s recent <em>An Explorer&rsquo;s Guide to Julian of Norwich</em> is a helpful introduction to Julian, her world, and the major themes of her writing. Be aware, however, that Rolf significantly overstates both the exceptionality and the danger of writing mystical theology in Middle English (rather than Latin) as a woman. By Julian&rsquo;s era of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, significant precedent existed for mystical theology written in Middle English, such as <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> and works by Richard Rolle. Moreover, mystical theology was the one field of theology open to women, since it is based on experience rather than the university studies that were closed to women.</p></li>
<li><p>Robyn Cadwallader&rsquo;s <em>The Anchoress</em> is not about Julian of Norwich, but it is a lovely novel about a young women who becomes an anchoress in medieval England.</p></li>

<p>In the liturgical year of the church, we have entered the season of Eastertide: fifty days — a week of weeks — during which we celebrate the Resurrection. We spent the forty days of Lent fasting and repenting, remembering our need for a Savior; we now spend even longer rejoicing that our Savior has come.</p>

<p>Each week from now through early June, those of us in liturgical traditions will start every worship service with this greeting and response: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen! He is risen indeed! Alleluia!</p>

<p>But what does it look like to celebrate resurrection?</p>

<p>Jesus' resurrection is his defeat of sin and death and evil. It is the promise that we, too, will be resurrected; that Jesus defeated death not only for himself but for all of us. When we proclaim the resurrection we proclaim the audacious hope that God is making all things new, restoring all things, bringing the kingdom of heaven into being.</p>

<p>Sometimes resurrection looks like miracles and renewal, broken things made whole, battles won. It looks like Aslan, light shining from his mane, breathing new life into dead stones, crushing evil.</p>

<p>But sometimes resurrection is Frodo and Sam, trudging into the barren darkness of Mordor with only a tiny spark of hope. Resurrection is dancing in the aisle at at Easter even as you weep for the loss of someone you love. Resurrection is taking your medications and making your millionth PB&amp;J and planting annuals in the spring.</p>

<p>Resurrection means clinging to the hope, the crazy, beautiful hope, that all of this — pain, joy, suffering — is being redeemed, is given meaning by the resurrection of God-become-human, of Jesus.</p>

<p>I want resurrection to be big and glorious, to be Aslan driving back the White Witch. But mostly, resurrection isn&rsquo;t like that. It&rsquo;s small and easy to miss. It&rsquo;s a pot of tea shared by friends on a cold day. It&rsquo;s a sympathetic word for the parent with a tired toddler in the grocery store. It&rsquo;s saying something kind when you want to be cutting.</p>

<p>Resurrection is carrying that spark of hope even when everything is bleak. Not a hope that ignores the darkness, but a hope that the risen Christ will — in fact, has — overcome the darkness.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why we celebrate Easter for fifty days. It&rsquo;s easy enough to sustain this hope for a day, especially a day filled with sweet breads and chocolate bunnies. But to celebrate the resurrection for seven weeks takes discipline and a commitment to carrying hope and Easter light into our ordinary lives.</p>

<p>This Eastertide, then, let us celebrate resurrection. Maybe we&rsquo;re like Lucy, and celebration is easy as we ride, breathless with joy, on Aslan&rsquo;s back. Maybe we&rsquo;re Samwise, desperately weary, barely able to remember anything green and living. Likely, we&rsquo;re somewhere in between. But whether or not the hope of resurrection comes easily, let us speak into our lives, our neighborhoods, our world: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen!</p>

<p>And let us listen carefully to hear that he is risen indeed. Alleluia.</p></div>

<p>Last week was the second week of Advent, so throughout the week we lit the candle of peace alongside the candle of hope. This second candle is also the candle of the holy family.</p>

<p>With hope and the prophets, the connection is clear. But what about peace and the holy family? If anything, the coming of Jesus disrupted their peace: the peace of Mary&rsquo;s life, when she accepts her supernatural pregnancy and all of its possible consequences; the peace of Joseph&rsquo;s life, as he learns that his betrothed will have child that is not his own; the peace of their small family, as Jesus is born at an inconvenient time and as the political consequences of bearing a king forces the young family to flee their country as refugees.</p>

<p>As I was thinking about peace this week, though, I began thinking about how sin manifests in broken relationships between people and how the peace that Jesus brings can heal those relationships.</p>

<p>Peace is not just the absence of conflict, whether neighbors ignoring each other as they carefully mow to the edge of their lawn or nations existing in a state of uneasy détente. True peace is not agreeing to disagree while silently looking down on a friend, nor is it constantly stifling rage and frustration to exchange banal pleasantries.</p>

<p>Instead, peace brings healing and restoration, understanding and compassion. This type of peace can weather conflict, and even exist during disagreements; this peace recognizes the dignity of others by honoring their status as beloved children of God. This peace brings unity without forcing uniformity.</p>

<p>This peace, the peace that Jesus promises, is the remedy for sin that disrupts our relationships with each other and with God. It&rsquo;s deeper and richer and, yes, much harder to achieve than mere pleasantness or forced conformity. It&rsquo;s a peace that exceeds the ability of fallen humanity, a peace available only through God.</p>

<p>And that brings us back to the holy family. God supernaturally restores peace between Joseph and Mary: Joseph, feeling betrayed by the woman he was to marry; Mary, surely fearful that her unwed pregnancy will erase her place in her community. But God brings them together, brings peace into their relationship, as they come together to raise the Son of God.</p>

<p>We see this peace in Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s relationship only in small glimpses: as Joseph takes Mary and Jesus to Egypt, fleeing Herod; as Mary and Joseph search, both frantic, for their 12-year-old son in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Did Joseph fully believe, fully understand who his son was? We have no way of knowing for sure. But we can see the peace of God at work in his life as he builds a life with Mary, with Jesus, with the other children that arrived. A peace that restored and preserved relationships that otherwise would have fractured.</p>

<p>I like to think about Mary at Advent: her willingness to become the mother of God, her passionate <em>magnificat,</em> the way she hides all the marvels and ponders them in her heart. But Joseph, too, shows a willingness to let God transform his life and rebuild what seemed to be destroyed when he learned that Mary was pregnant with a child not his own.</p>

<p>Peace will look different in each of our lives, as each of us has relationships broken and strained in different ways and each of us tends to harm others in different ways.</p>

<p>But this Advent season, may the peace of Christ dwell richly in us as the body of Christ, so that we can know the power of Jesus to heal the effects of sin in our communities.</p></div>

<p>I&rsquo;m a week behind on Advent (not to mention the last six weeks of silence on the blog). But every year, I find Advent more and more meaningful. These four Sundays leading up to Christmas invite us into the tension between the already and the not yet, darkness and light, sorrow and joy.</p>

<p>Christmas can often seem like a season where we have to be jolly and bright, pretending that everything is fine so we can create perfect family memories. But Advent says: there is darkness, and pain, and sorrow, and waiting, and longing. The answer has come and is coming, but the longing remains.</p>

<p>In the first week of Advent, we light the candle of hope, or the candle of the prophets. This candle reminds us that even in the darkness, we can see the light of Christ. It may be small, or distant, or unclear; Isaiah could not clearly see the great light for the people in darkness. But the darkness does not overcome the light. In fact, in the darkness, we come to appreciate the light more than we would in the day.</p>

<p>The past two weeks have been especially full of darkness for me. Nothing beyond the ordinary tragedies of human existence: a friend who lost her mother, another friend who received a serious diagnosis, my own struggle against the fog of depression. But the pain and the sorrow, the longing for things to be different, have loomed large as my Advent season begins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m conditioned, by years of consumerism and Hallmark sentiments, to feel that I&rsquo;m doing something wrong if I don&rsquo;t enter December with joy and anticipation and a list of fun family activities. Weeping angrily over suffering isn&rsquo;t precisely photogenic, nor is cocooning myself in blankets while my kids fight over Christmas music.</p>

<p>But the hard parts of life don&rsquo;t just vanish because we put the lights on the tree and hang the stockings on the mantel. The suffering and longing remains, even if we try to bury it under tinsel and trips to see Santa.</p>

<p>Celebrating Advent, though, creates space for us to feel both the sorrow and the joy. Advent acknowledges the pain and suffering in our lives, and then points us to hope, to light, to life, to the child in the manger.</p>

<p>Advent means that we can attend a funeral one day, shedding tears and grieving with friends, and take the kids Christmas shopping the next, delighting in their excitement and joy. Advent means that we cry angry tears over the friend diagnosed with an illness and then joyful tears as the candlelight spreads during the Christmas Eve service.</p>

<p>Advent says: you are waiting and longing for your Savior — and behold, he is coming. Make the paths straight, the mountains and valleys level, because our hope is not in vain.</p>

<p>The prophets of old clung to this truth just as we still cling to it. We hope, not because all is already as it should be, but because we know the world is not yet made right. We hope because we believe in the advent of the One who will make all things new, wipe away every tear, heal every ill.</p>

<p>And so we light this first advent candle, the candle of hope, the candle of the prophets, with longing and joy in our hearts.</p></div>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the Evolving Faith Conference this weekend, hosted in the mountains of North Carolina by Sarah Bessey and Rachel Held Evans (I met Sarah Bessey today, and I fangirled a little bit). I&rsquo;m a bit burned out after hearing so many fascinating talks from fascinating people (and having fascinating conversations with a friend I don&rsquo;t see often enough).</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not writing much; I&rsquo;m not sure I can formulate many cohesive sentences tonight. But I was struck by how the speakers, ranging from Pete Enns to Wil Gafney to Jen Hatmaker to Osheta Moore, kept returning to a theme of lament.</p>

<p>Lament for friendships lost, for conceptions of God lost. Lament for the pain and isolation of experiencing a deconstruction of faith. Lament for the hurt and sorrow caused by faith communities both personally and in the world through patriarchy and white supremacy.</p>

<p>But each speaker also affirmed that, out of this sorrow and pain and loneliness, we can find God again, even in places where we didn&rsquo;t expect to find God. We can find community. We can regain, regrow a faith that is deeper, more resilient. We can rediscover hope in the peace and justice of God.</p>

<p>We can find hope in knowing that we are God&rsquo;s beloved.</p>

<p>My journey of deconstruction and reconstruction hasn&rsquo;t been particularly dramatic; it&rsquo;s been slow, and I&rsquo;ve been blessed with community along the way. I haven&rsquo;t experienced a dramatic break or a traumatic expulsion from a community of faith. But even as I&rsquo;ve intellectually wrestled with various doctrines, part of my heart has always been afraid to engage, afraid of God&rsquo;s rejection and disappointment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working — I&rsquo;ve been working for the last year — to integrate my head and my heart. And I keep hearing (as I wrote last week) the word that I am beloved.</p>

<p>Hearing the speakers today, I was reassured that I am beloved. That if I earnestly seek God, I will find God. That God is never disappointed in my questions and confusion and sin and even anger.</p>

<p>And that, right there, is the gospel. All I can hope to do is to immerse myself more and more fully into this truth.</p></div>
