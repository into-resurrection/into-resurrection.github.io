<p>So I tend to be a tiny bit over ambitious at times.</p>

<p>I also indulge in ironic understatements. I’ll leave it to you, dear reader, to consider how the two may be related.</p>

<p>Anyway. I have been trying to convince myself for the last few weeks that I actually can feed, clothe and occasionally bathe three small people; do a freelance project; apply and interview for a job at my church; lead a Girl Scout troop; move into a new house; and write two blog posts per week while also at least occasionally saying hello to my husband and, if I&rsquo;m lucky, sleeping.</p>

<p>But I’m once again getting my periodic reminder that I am not, in fact, either superhuman or in possession of a time turner. And since this blog neither whines at me, pays me, or operates on a definite timeline, I think it’s the thing that has to go for the next two weeks. I’m disappointed that I don’t get to write about Sor Juana and Tamar until next month, but unlike my truck rental they can wait.</p>

<p>I will be back to my normal posting schedule on May 7. I have it on good authority that the internet will still be around when I come back.</p>

<p>(Also? I’m writing this on my phone while waiting for one of my daughters to finish ballet, and I thoroughly hate it. I feel old now.)</p></div>

<p>Two weeks ago, I did something I&rsquo;ve never done before: with a roiling stomach and a slight quiver in my knees, I walked to the pulpit in my church to preach a sermon.</p>

<p>When my priest asked me back in January if I&rsquo;d be willing to preach, I jumped at the chance. I enjoy public speaking and I&rsquo;ve missed lecturing to the humanities students once a month, as I did at my academic job. And since we use the lectionary, I had an assigned passage already and no need to worry about coming up with a topic.</p>

<p>But despite my initial excitement, I was blindsided by my own emotional reaction to preaching.</p>

<p>I heard a woman preach for the first time less than a year ago. And despite believing in and supporting women preaching for at least the last ten years of my life, those previous twenty-five years of believing that women shouldn&rsquo;t preach still linger in my soul. And so I was overwhelmed with uncertainty, doubt and feelings of unworthiness as I began to prepare my sermon.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter that I affirm and argue for and write about women preaching. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve been writing regularly for Christians for Biblical Equality. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve led several adult Sunday School classes. Something about stepping into the pulpit brought out all of my insecurity. I could, and do, argue that women, in general, should preach. But what about when &ldquo;women&rdquo; meant me, specifically? Could I do this? Could I preach?</p>

<p>I was, either ironically or appropriately, preaching on the story of Thomas and his doubts, from John 20. My central point was that Jesus meets us in our doubts, drawing us out of those doubts and into himself. I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced periods of doubt about my faith, especially when my critical thinking turns into cynical thinking. But now I was drowning in doubt about my <em>worthiness</em> to preach.</p>

<p>And I want to be clear that my insecurity was about my intrinsic <em>worthiness</em> to preach, my status in the eyes of God. I never doubted my skills in studying a text, preparing a message, and speaking to the church. I&rsquo;m actually pretty good at all of that, and after fourteen years of teaching I have plenty of experience in prepping, teaching and speaking. So I never felt unsure about my skill or my talent; the doubt went much deeper, to the question of whether I as a woman could serve God and the church by preaching — whether God wanted that kind of service from me.</p>

<p>And so, I felt weirdly divided: I thoroughly enjoyed prepping the sermon, but I felt existential anxiety every time I thought about actually preaching it.</p>

<p>Then came Holy Week. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting, honestly, to meet God in any deep way; the previous month had been busy and stressful and not incredibly conducive to cultivating spiritual openness for the greatest feast of the Christian year. And yet, kneeling at the foot of the cross on Good Friday to pray, I knew exactly what I needed to leave there at the cross, what I needed Jesus to take up for me: my feelings of unworthiness.</p>

<p>Much to my amazement, Jesus did take them from me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not much of one for spiritual experiences; I tend to be much more cerebral than emotional, and I&rsquo;m still not entirely comfortable with that strange and mysterious third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. But I experienced an otherwise inexplicable emotional relief that Friday night at the cross. The burden and shame of my unworthiness as a woman disappeared.</p>

<p>I was still nervous the next week when I got up to preach. This was a new audience, and they didn&rsquo;t need to pay attention in order to get a passing grade on an exam. And I certainly felt the weight of preaching: getting something wrong about Shakespeare probably won&rsquo;t affect a student&rsquo;s entire life, but getting something wrong about Jesus might hurt one of my listeners. And yet I no longer felt unworthy as a woman; I felt beloved by God and supported by my church community.</p>

<p>And I even enjoyed myself, stretching muscles that I hadn&rsquo;t used in a while.</p>

<p>I hope that I&rsquo;ll be able to preach again. I imagine that I&rsquo;ll still feel doubt and uncertainty and I&rsquo;ll still wonder whether God is really calling me, specifically. But Jesus meets us in our doubts and calls us to serve him; how can I respond better than with Thomas' affirmation, &ldquo;My lord and my God&rdquo;?</p>

<p><em>I started writing this post a week ago, to go up on the 12th — then I spent the weekend at the Festival of Faith and Writing and didn&rsquo;t actually post anything. I assumed I&rsquo;d have to rework the beginning because it&rsquo;s April and it should be spring … but I woke up to snow on the ground yesterday so Henryson&rsquo;s April is still much closer to my reality than Chaucer&rsquo;s!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the opening to Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>Canterbury Tales,</em> with the sweet showers of April bringing life and energy to places and people parched by the drought of winter. Actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how my April has made me want to huddle indoors, by a fire, rather than venturing out on any sort of pilgrimage (even just to the grocery store). I feel much more like the narrator of Robert Henryson&rsquo;s <em>Testament of Cresseid,</em> who ventures outside on an April night in Scotland to watch Venus rise, but is defeated by the whistling north wind and returns indoors to thaw by his fire.</p>

<p>I try to bolster myself during this long, cold spring with thoughts of superiority; after all, <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/byron/don-juan/1/">as Byron asserts,</a> &ldquo;Happy the nations of the moral north!&rdquo; But then I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the assertion that northern people (that is, Europeans) are morally superior to other people groups, even if Byron with his notorious lack of morality certainly meant this line as a sly joke. So I turn to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44428/the-negro-speaks-of-rivers">Langston Hughes</a> for an antidote, with his soul grown deep like a wide, warm river.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the power of poetry last week, when I spent twenty minutes reading poems to a group of first grade students (including one of my daughters). <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope is the thing with feathers&rdquo;</a> lost them, sadly, although Dickinson is never my favorite so I secretly sympathize. But they loved <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58421/on-paper">&ldquo;on paper&rdquo; by Jacqueline Woodson</a> and they giggled through William Carlos Williams' <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say">&ldquo;This is Just to Say.&rdquo;</a> Perhaps best of all, they were amazed that Billy Collins would write a poem about <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55737/cheerios">Cheerios,</a> which is humorous enough to capture a first-grader but hooks us adults with its meditation on age and aging and time.</p>

<p>When I taught English classes, I read poetry regularly. I read poems from Homer and Sappho; Dante, Chaucer, and Marie de France; Donne, Herbert, Mary Sidney, and Milton. I even, occasionally, ventured into more modern poetry. But since leaving my teaching job nearly a year ago, I&rsquo;ve read much less poetry. I have at least one prose novel going all the time (often more), but as I was searching for poems to bring to my daughter&rsquo;s class I realized how much I miss reading poetry.</p>

<p>Poetry has an evocative and emotional power that often evades prose, even the most lyrical and powerful prose. All writers must wrestle with words, striving to convey ideas and emotions to their readers. But the poet must be sensitive to the meaning of the words and their sounds, the ideas and the rhythms conveyed by each word. But the very best poems do this in a way that bypasses our head and goes straight to our heart.</p>

<p>Even the most intellectual of poets, like John Donne or T.S. Eliot, offer a depth beyond intellectual puzzles and learned allusions. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud">Donne&rsquo;s Holy Sonnet 10</a> contains a brief argument against the power of death, but the poem&rsquo;s punch comes not in its logic but its resounding final lines: &ldquo;One short sleep past, we wake eternally / And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.&rdquo; The weight and finality of the heavy syllables in the last line underscore emotionally the truth that death will indeed die.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why the Bible contains so much poetry. The Psalms, of course, but also various songs and hymns are preserved throughout scripture. Rhythm and music help people remember, especially crucial in largely illiterate cultures; but this memory goes beyond intellect to embed itself in the soul as poetry links mind and emotion.</p>

<p>I have, at times, wished that the bible were more like a guidebook, or perhaps a systematic theology. But we are more than our minds; we are our bodies and our emotions and our communities. God wants to reach us in every aspect of our being, and so in addition to Paul we have the parable of Jesus; in addition to the chronicles of the kings we have psalms; and the whole of scripture is framed by poems about creation and new creation.</p>

<p>So this month, in celebration of poetry, curl up by the fire (or if you&rsquo;re lucky, find a pleasant park bench) and read a poem. Read a psalm, or Mary&rsquo;s magnificat, or Miriam&rsquo;s song; read John Donne or George Herbert or Mary Sidney or, for a giggle, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43639/the-disappointment">Aphra Behn&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Disappointment.&rdquo;</a> Find a new poet or revisit an old friend, and engage your mind and your heart.</p></div>

<p>Most parents experience at least a twinge of emotion as they send their child off to kindergarten: that first day of school marks a significant transition. I certainly felt that twinge when I dropped my oldest off for the first time. But for me, the twinge was heightened by the fact that I wasn’t just sending my daughter into a new experience for her; I was entering a new experience myself.</p>

<p>You see, I was homeschooled. About six weeks into first grade at a public school, my parents pulled me out. They meant it as a short-term solution, but my younger siblings and I ended up homeschooled through our high school graduations. And we became, gradually, the sort of homeschooling family that views public schools as evil, hotbeds of liberal politics and myriad vices.</p>

<p>So how did I end up sending my own children to public schools? …</p>

<p>I have a few things I want to say to April in the Chicagoland area: seriously? Wintry mix that is actually huge fluffy snowflakes all afternoon? Highs in the 30s? Where is my spring? I DEMAND SPRING. I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the south and I want to wear my Tevas, not my parka.</p>

<p>Ahem. Some thoughts and updates to start off the month:</p>

<p><strong>Moving!</strong></p>

<p>We bought a new house (yay!) and after assembling countless Ikea bookshelves I am ready to start unpacking my books. The vast majority of them have been boxed up for the last year, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get them out. We won&rsquo;t move all the way in for a few weeks yet, which gives us some time to paint and do cosmetic work on the house and, most importantly, set up the bookshelves.</p>

<p>(Also, I&rsquo;m pleased to report that my marriage survived both a trip to Ikea and assembling Ikea furniture. Life achievement unlocked.)</p>

<p><strong>Whole30:</strong></p>

<p>March was also my Whole30 month. It ended up being more like a Whole24, and I added legumes back in about halfway through. I decided when I began that I wasn&rsquo;t going to stress about &ldquo;compliance,&rdquo; making sure that no forbidden food passed my lips. So I definitely ate some dairy (blue cheese crumbles on my Chick-fil-A salad) and sugar (in my Panera salad dressing), but for the most part I avoided dairy, sugar and grains.</p>

<p>The Whole30 program hits my perfectionist buttons with its philosophy that you have to do it <em>perfectly</em> or start the whole program over, but I gave myself permission from the beginning to not be perfect. I tend to strive for perfection then give up in frustration when I&rsquo;m not perfect, so I knew that if I wanted to actually reset my eating habits I needed to give myself some room to fail.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m pleased to say that Whole30 (err, Whole24) was overall a good experience. I don&rsquo;t intend to keep up with the restrictions, or move towards a paleo diet, but it was good to remind myself that I can survive without sugary carbs. I found a fantastic new pork roast recipe, I reincorporated more veggies in my diet, and I discovered that cashew butter is <em>really good.</em> So I&rsquo;m counting it as a success (and very much enjoying my hot cross buns and chocolate Easter cake this week).</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong></p>

<p>I finished <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen</em> (Drew G.I. Hart), and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in racism in the church. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy read, but it is an important one. I also finished <em>Opting Out: Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home</em> (Pamela Stone). Stone examines the reasons why high-achieving women quit prestigious careers when they have children, and while her research certainly lined up with my own experience it made me angry all over again that even supposedly family-friendly workplaces do so little to support women (or men) to balance the demands of family and job, which pushes families into traditional gender roles even when that&rsquo;s not really what they want.</p>

<p>In fiction, I just finished Marie Lu&rsquo;s <em>Warcross.</em> One of the blurbs compared it to <em>Neuromancer,</em> and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite right; Lu crafts a compelling story, but her writing isn&rsquo;t quite on the level of Gibson. But I do think it&rsquo;s fair to compare it, and compare it favorably, to Ernest Cline&rsquo;s <em>Ready Player One.</em> Both feature a young protagonist unexpectedly caught up in a computer game with far-reaching global consequences, but I found Lu&rsquo;s world and characters more vivid than Cline&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also slowly making my way through <em>Gilead,</em> by Marilynne Robinson; I&rsquo;ve been putting of her novels for inscrutable reasons, but I am enjoying slowly taking in her gorgeous prose. And I&rsquo;m still working on Jürgen Moltmann&rsquo;s <em>The Spirit of Life</em>, and it is still rocking my world. I&rsquo;ve never had a good understanding of the Holy Spirit, and Moltmann is giving me so many new ways to think about this third person of the Trinity.</p>

<p><strong>Coming up:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning a post on Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz for my women in Christianity series, and one on Tamar for stories of subversion in scripture. Also, this is April, both national poetry month and the month when medievalists celebrate ancient languages — so expect something on medieval poetry.</p>

<p>On Monday next week, I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://erinwasinger.com/blog-2/">Erin Wasinger&rsquo;s blog</a> with a piece for her &ldquo;Passing Notes&rdquo; series on choosing public schools — come for my piece and stay for the rest of series, which is great! And if you missed it, I wrote about six influential medieval women for the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/6-medieval-women-who-shaped-christian-theology">CBE blog Arise.</a></p></div>
