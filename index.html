<p><em>Part 4 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2,</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-3">Part 3.</a></em></p>

<p>On Monday, I offered some reasons why men (and women) should read more books by and about women. But how do you go about doing this, if you&rsquo;re realizing that your Goodreads history is overbalanced towards men?</p>

<p>First, and probably most obviously, find books by women on topics or in genres that you enjoy. Enjoy literary fiction? Check out female nominees and past winners for the <a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2017.html#.W1nezi2ZN_U">National Book Award</a> or the <a href="https://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/news/man-booker-prize-2018-longlist-announced">Man Booker Prize.</a> Enjoy genre fiction? Browse a publisher&rsquo;s catalog or the library shelves for books by women in that genre.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for theology or spiritual writing by women, many websites and publications have reading lists. Try <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2018/june/10-new-or-lesser-known-female-theologians-worth-knowing.html">this one,</a> from <em>Christianity Today,</em> or <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/very-egalitarian-summer-reading-list-12-books-add-your-pile">this one,</a> from Christians for Biblical Equality, or <a href="https://dailytheology.org/2018/03/08/women-theologians-you-should-be-reading-right-now-a-primer/">this one</a> from Daily Theology.</p>

<p>Next, be willing to try new types of books. Give <a href="https://amzn.to/2LRmAro"><em>Pastrix</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2LDJnKy"><em>Still: Notes on a Mid-Faith Crisis</em></a> a chance. Try a family drama — I&rsquo;m fond of Liane Moriarty at the moment, and it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with Jennifer Weiner. These books are by women, about women, and marketed to women, but they capture the human experience and are just fun reads.</p>

<p>Not everyone likes everything; you may decide that a particular genre is not for you. But you may also find a whole new type of book to enjoy.</p>

<p>Once you find books by women that you enjoy, tell people about them! Both my husband and I are in (separate) theology book clubs (yes, we&rsquo;re nerds), and we both work to notice when our reading lists veer too heavily male and to make alternate suggestions. And fortunately, our friends will do the same, which means that we also receive new recommendations.</p>

<p>And, as you are able, purchase books by women. Publishers want to make money, so creating a demand for a certain type of book will encourage publishers to publish and promote women writers.</p>

<p>Finally, especially if you have young children in your life, work to normalize reading about and empathizing with girls for <em>both</em> girls and boys. Shannon Hale has <a href="http://shannonhale.tumblr.com/post/171419839125/were-ready-a-post-for-kidlitwomen">heartbreaking stories</a> about parents, teachers and librarians who steer (or shove) boys away from books about girls. Even though we not only allow but encourage girls to read about boys, the reverse is not true.</p>

<p>So if you have children, or work with children, or are in a position to recommend books to children, don&rsquo;t always give books about trucks and monsters to boys. Give them books like <a href="https://amzn.to/2uSCWJN"><em>The Princess in Black</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2NMnfLj"><em>The Princess and the Pizza</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2uSwbYv"><em>Journey</em></a>, or recommend them. Suggest that boys read about Serena Williams and Ruth Bader Ginsberg (the <em>Who Was …?</em> series is great for elementary schoolers). Don&rsquo;t just give <em>Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls</em> to girls; direct boys to it too.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to replace Harry Potter and Holden Caulfield (okay, maybe Holden Caulfield). But we do need to make sure that boys and girls are expected to read about women protagonists, and that boys feel as comfortable identifying with Katniss Everdeen as girls do identifying with Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Changing large cultural attitudes towards women writers will be a long, slow process. Significant cultural pressure leads to the dismissal of women&rsquo;s writing as fluffy, emotional or specific rather than universal, and the problem is only worse within theological and spiritual writing.</p>

<p>But slow as change may be, it starts with deliberate choices to value women&rsquo;s voices and experiences and to reevaluate our assumptions about the values of masculinity, rationality, and objectivity. And that change can start with the simple act of picking up a book by a woman.</p>

<p>Come back on Monday for my list of women writers to get you started!</p>

<p><em>Part 3 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1 here</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2</a> here.</em></p>

<p>In part 1 of this series, I argued that modern American society makes it easy for men to avoid reading books by women — and that this is a problem because it devalues not just women&rsquo;s contributions but women&rsquo;s personhood. And in part 2, I argued that the solution cannot be for women to write like men (whatever that means), because instead of addressing the problem this solution continues to devalue women.</p>

<p>So how can we address these problems? What might make men more likely to read books by and about women? I will have some practical suggestions in Thursday&rsquo;s post, but today I want to focus on <em>why</em> men should read women authors.</p>

<p>In the big picture, as I&rsquo;ve argued, not reading books by women reinforces — intentionally or not — the idea that women are not fully human in the way that men are. But I think many men, like the writer of the <em>Relevant</em> article I discussed in part 1, don&rsquo;t set out to either avoid or devalue women.</p>

<p>They (and women, too) simply swim in cultural waters that make it easy to dismiss books by women, especially spiritual or theological books written by women.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So why should we intentionally seek out books by women? Beyond the big picture of treating women as fully human and fully capable of writing books relevant to men as well as women, I see three reasons to read women.</p>

<p><strong>First, developing empathy:</strong> a growing body of research suggests that reading fiction helps us to develop empathy, sympathetic understanding of the emotions of others. Empathy makes us more kind, less likely to stereotype, better able to understand why a person may make particular choices.</p>

<p>From the very beginnings of their reading lives, girls read about boys and girls, developing empathy for men as well as other women. Far too often, however, boys are directed away from books about girls. Boys can identify with Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, but not Jo Marsh or Katniss Everdeen.</p>

<p>But limiting the characters boys and men encounter also limits the empathy they develop: the empathy extends to characters like them (male), but not to female characters and, by extension, to girls and women.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This problem is intersectional, too — not limited to gender. When we expect everyone to identify with white men, but only women to identify with women or minorities to identify with minorities, we limit empathetic development and reinforce the sexism and racism that sees women and minorities as deviating from the norm.</p>

<p><strong>Second, embracing diversity:</strong> Alongside developing empathy, reading books by and about a wide variety of people develops an appreciation for diverse perspectives and experiences.</p>

<p>No matter how much we know better, we easily slide into the assumption that our perspective and our experiences are normal and right. Interacting with a variety of people helps us overcome this assumption: what seems normal and obvious to us might be completely foreign to another, and we can learn from that new perspective.</p>

<p>We should embrace this sort of diversity in a variety of ways, but reading in particular allows us to deepen our historical perspectives. We have much to learn from writers and characters of the past, beginning with humility.</p>

<p>Like developing empathy, this value extends beyond the question of why we should read books by and about women. But gaining the perspective of women on their lives and experiences will enrich our own understanding of the human condition.</p>

<p><strong>Third, challenging the idea that men are the norm:</strong> When society treats men as the standard of what it means to be human, the male experience is valued above the female experience. And western patriarchy makes men rational and women emotional, men able to transcend the body while women are trapped by their bodies, men capable of an objectivity that women cannot attain.</p>

<p>Reading and valuing women writers is a part of learning to value &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; characteristics. We must learn to value these traits, often gendered as feminine but in reality common to all humans, in order to integrate and value our whole human selves — mental, emotional, physical, spiritual.</p>

<p>To be sure, individual readers and writers will have preferences for the more intellectual or the more confessional, the more objective or the more subjective. But we need to stop imagining that books by men (and this is especially prevalent in theological and spiritual writing) are intellectual and objective and therefore better than confessional and subjective books, which are often written by women.</p>

<p>Theology cannot be merely intellectual; it is also lived. And the intellect is not divorced from context or free of bias; our reason is shaped by our experience, including our experience as a man or a woman. No view of God is purely rational; human beings cannot attain some sort of pure rationality.</p>

<p>Diversifying our reading, and especially our theological reading, helps us to see the limitations of what we consider normative and the flaws in the idea that theology based in experience is inferior to theology based in reason.</p>

<p>Right now, a whole host of women spiritual writers are reminding Christians that we need to pay attention to how our theologies can be lived and embodied in the world. They don&rsquo;t argue that we should toss out all the church fathers, but they do remind us that beautiful intellectual systems can crumble when they meet our embodied lives — and often the flaw is in the theology, not the embodiment.</p>

<p>When we elevate the male and the intellectual as objective and true, we lose the wisdom gained by experience and the insights offered by our emotions. I do not mean to suggest that women are more emotional than intellectual, but in our current western culture women are more free to express their emotions and write based on experience. And instead of devaluing their perspective, we should interrogate our own assumptions about male rationality and objectivity.</p>

<p>To boil this post down to one reason to read more women writers: patriarchy harms not just women, but also men. When men don&rsquo;t read books by and about women, their perspectives are limited, their empathy may be stunted, and they place far too much confidence in their own point of view.</p>

<p><em>Part 2 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1 here.</a></em></p>

<p>In Monday&rsquo;s post, I raised a problem — that men don&rsquo;t read books by women at the same rate as they read books by men — and argued that this problem is a symptom of a larger problem. That problem? Society still does not view women as quite fully human, because women&rsquo;s experiences are assumed to be <em>specific</em> while men&rsquo;s experiences are <em>universal.</em></p>

<p>So how might we begin to address this problem? Setting aside the impossible dream of smashing the patriarchy in one fell swoop, encouraging men to read more books by and about women is a good start. After all, from the time we are young, we women are expected to read books by men and about men, expected to be able to identify with male protagonists. Why not ask the same of men?</p>

<p>One way to get men to read books by women involves obscuring the author&rsquo;s gender. From George Eliot to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree_Jr.">James Tiptree, Jr.</a> to J.K. Rowling, women have used pen names and initials to gain male audiences for their books.</p>

<p>This tactic is harder, though, for writers of non-fiction. In order to publish a book, non-fiction writers need a platform, an audience for their words — and that makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to obscure gender. So women who write non-fiction cannot easily pass themselves off as men in order to gain male readers.</p>

<p>The next solution that presents itself? Women just need to write more like men. This advice surfaces periodically in a variety of contexts: women should apologize less, use &ldquo;just&rdquo; less, cut out the uptalk and the vocal fry, all in order to be taken more seriously because they sound more like men.</p>

<p>At one panel at this year&rsquo;s Festival of Faith and Writing, one woman writer suggested that in order to get male readers, women need to write more serious theology and leave behind the personal and confessional style so common in women&rsquo;s spiritual writing in particular.</p>

<p>This advice is not entirely bad. I think women do apologize far too often for simply existing in the world. And women who write Christian non-fiction for a general audience do tend towards (or are pushed towards) the personal and confessional even when they write about theology.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem: the advice to write more like a man continues to elevate the male voice as normative. And when that normative male voice is also viewed as objective and logical, the female voice is seen as deviant, subjective and emotional. So in asking women to write more like men, we continue to devalue qualities viewed as &ldquo;feminine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do think that women should be writing more theological books, that women should have and fully use their intellectual grounding to challenge and encourage the church. But if we don&rsquo;t challenge the assumption that women write subjectively and emotionally, and therefore lack authority or relevance to the church as a whole, we have not solved the problem.</p>

<p>Back in the high middle ages, women were barred from the university education that allowed someone to participate in scholastic theology. But women could still hear from God, could still be mystics; for many women (like Julian of Norwich or <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-23-2017-catherine-of-siena">Catherine of Siena</a>), mysticism offered their only entrance into the world of medieval theology, and they took full advantage of that entrance to participate in and even shape wider theological discussions.</p>

<p>Similarly, for many women today the devotional or confessional style — often personal and emotional — is the best route into spiritual and theological writing. As <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore recently revealed,</a> she like many other women was blocked from the avenues to theological education and authority. But unlike the medieval mystic theologies written by women that were widely read, the more personal, devotional and confessional styles of these modern women writers leads to their dismissal as fluffy or relevant only to other women.</p>

<p>We can, and should, not only allow but encourage women to write more &ldquo;like men,&rdquo; if by that we mean that women should be writing solidly intellectual theology, like a James K.A. Smith or a N.T. Wright. Women are no less capable of this work than men, and women&rsquo;s perspectives will help challenge the assumption that male perspectives are, or should be, normative.</p>

<p>But this cannot be the entire solution. We must also recognize the value of the personal and the confessional. After all, Augustine&rsquo;s <em>Confessions</em> is a classic of Christian theology for good reason. Theologies influenced by experience, mediated by more personal and emotional styles of writing, can be just as valuable to the church as intellectual or academic writing.</p>

<p>And so men <em>should</em> read books like Glennon Doyle&rsquo;s <em>Love Warrior</em> and Jen Hatmaker&rsquo;s <em>Seven</em> and Sarah Bessey&rsquo;s <em>Out of Sorts</em> and pretty much anything by Lauren Winner. These women draw on their experiences to offer valuable insights to the whole church, not only to other women.</p>

<p>Women shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide the fact that they are women, either by obscuring their names or jettisoning so-called &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; writing styles. We (both men and women readers) should value their full personhood, including their experience of being a woman in the world, and not see it as a deviation from or poor imitation of the normative experience of men.</p>

<p>And so I resist placing the responsibility on women to attract male readers by contorting themselves into man-like shapes. Instead, men should be willing to read a variety of books by women, from the academic to the confessional. And perhaps in the process, more men can discover the value of personal and experiential theologies and we can work in earnest to dismantle the idea that theology must be intellectual and abstract.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 1 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women, how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men, and why this is a problem.</em></p>

<p>Several months ago, <em>Relevant</em> magazine posted an article by a male writer about his foray into reading books written by women. After realizing that neither he nor his friends read anything written by women, he decided that he would get recommendations from a helpful employee at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>

<p>He ended up reading Kim Harrison&rsquo;s urban fantasy novel <em>Dead Witch Walking,</em> and after mocking the book/genre, he discovers that he gained a new perspective on life by reading a book with a female protagonist.</p>

<p>My short summary does not do justice to this article, but it was every bit as bad as you&rsquo;re imagining. So bad, in fact, that after concerted pushback the article was taken down within a couple of hours.</p>

<p>But this article, and then a panel at the Festival of Faith and Writing in April on men reading women, keep coming back to me. After eighteen years studying and teaching English in colleges and after a lifetime as a woman, particularly a Christian woman, I have no difficulty believing that men don&rsquo;t read nearly as many books by women as they do by men.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to receive at least a BA in English without reading more than a handful of women writers. I&rsquo;m going to assume that if this is true in English — where the whole point of the major is reading many books by many authors — it&rsquo;s equally true in pretty much every other field.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Because of this state of affairs, I even have some sympathy for the writer of the <em>Relevant</em> article; I doubt that he intentionally avoided books by women simply because women wrote them. And when he became aware of the deficit in his reading, he did begin the process of addressing it.</p>

<p>But his reading experience shows just how pervasive the idea is that books by and about men are for everyone, while books by and about women are for women. Because that&rsquo;s how men end up not reading women: they assume that books by women are not relevant to them or their life experiences.</p>

<p>So much social weight lies behind this assumption. At perhaps the most obvious level, books by women often have clearly feminine covers: flowers, pastels, and flowing scripts visually signal a particular audience. (The author Maureen Johnson, back in 2013, initiated a widespread conversation about gendered book covers that led to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/coverflip-maureen-johnson_n_3231935.html?slideshow=true#gallery/296089/0">these delightful gender-flipped covers</a>).</p>

<p>As an example, I just started reading an advance copy of <em>Fat and Faithful</em> by Nicole Morgan. Morgan writes about bodies and embodiment and incarnation and living as the image of God, topics that apply to men and women. But because a woman wrote this book about bodies, is anyone surprised that the cover is a lovely purple with the title in a fancy cursive script, indicating that it&rsquo;s marketed towards women?</p>

<p>Covers and marketing alone, however, do not make up the entire problem. The problem behind the marketing problem? Ingrained patriarchy leads us to assume that men&rsquo;s experiences and perspectives are universal in a way that women&rsquo;s simply aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The roots of this assumption run deep in the history of western culture and emerge every time <a href="http://shannonhale.tumblr.com/post/171419839125/were-ready-a-post-for-kidlitwomen">someone tells Shannon Hale</a> that boys don&rsquo;t read books about princesses and every time women&rsquo;s books are presumed to be too fluffy for major literary awards.</p>

<p>Why is this attitude a problem? Does it actually matter whether or not men read books by and about women?</p>

<p>This attitude suggests that women are not quite fully human in the way that men are, not quite capable of speaking to or reflecting the human experience, not able to transcend the specific and achieve universality.</p>

<p>In this view, Harry Potter teaches us about what it means to be human; Rachel Morgan, the protagonist of <em>Dead Witch Walking</em>, teaches us what it means to be a woman — knowledge that may be interesting for men, but not necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, I think it is a problem when men don&rsquo;t read books by women, or when they read books by women expecting to find difference rather than common humanity. They miss out on the rich fullness of the human experience and, at the same time, elevate their own experience into universal truth.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I&rsquo;ll be diving into these problems in greater depth and also offering some suggestions on where to start reading women. Check back on Thursday for a new post on whether part of the solution involves women writing more like men.</p>

<p>I realized that I am currently immersed in narratives about humans with special abilities. I don&rsquo;t know what that says about me right now, or about pop culture: wish fulfillment? Interest in the post-human, the next stage of evolution? The insidious spread of superhero narratives? A bizarre and ultimately meaningless coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Television:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been binge-watching my way through the most recent season of <em>Agents of Shield,</em> now available on Netflix. I&rsquo;m a fan of the show, especially of the relationships that have developed amongst the characters, although I can tell that the writers are struggling at times to tell a compelling story that stays within the boundaries of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) without actually intersecting with the films.</p>

<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s Phil Coulson and his team just time traveling to the future, as one does, foiling Hydra, as one does, and averting the literal tearing apart of the earth, as one does — while the Avengers are off battling Thanos. It&rsquo;s a little bit much, you know?</p>

<p>But as always in the show, the best part lies in the very human struggles to find a place and to learn how to use abilities, inhuman or not, when life takes unexpected turns. Plus, I&rsquo;m crossing all my fingers that Fitz and Simmons just might be the first happy and successful romance in a Whedon-run show.</p>

<p><strong>Comics:</strong></p>

<p>My second pop culture narratives of supernatural abilities come from Marvel as well. After watching <em>Runaways</em> on Hulu, I&rsquo;ve started reading the comics, starting with Brian Vaughn&rsquo;s run in the early 2000s. (Side note: you should definitely read his independent series, <a href="https://amzn.to/2zchRP5"><em>Saga</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2MMQzRi"><em>Paper Girls.</em></a> Really, go find them now.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve quite enjoyed the comics. They differ some from the Hulu show, as I expected, and the differences have kept the story fresh even as it overlaps with what I watched. But I&rsquo;m definitely a sucker for a coming-of-age series about a bunch of young people with emerging powers and complicated parental relationships. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying Brian Vaughn&rsquo;s writing, and I&rsquo;m very excited to work my way up to Rainbow Rowell&rsquo;s run as writer of <em>Runaways.</em></p>

<p>(And another side note: I ❤️❤️❤️ Rainbow Rowell <em>soooo</em> much, and <em>squee</em> she&rsquo;s writing another Baz and Simon book! If you have never read her novels, there&rsquo;s still plenty of summer left to read at least <a href="https://amzn.to/2tW52Dz"><em>Fangirl</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2ML0Xcn"><em>Carry On.</em></a> Do it. Do it now.)</p>

<p><strong>Novels:</strong></p>

<p>Moving away from Marvel, I just finished V.E. Schwab&rsquo;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2zdDIWk"><em>Vicious.</em></a> The ExtraOrdinary humans in this novel (the EOs) gain their powers from near-death experiences, which raises the question of whether those who come back with super-human abilities are still, in fact, human. Schwab doesn&rsquo;t answer the question, but each EO in the novel provides a different angle on the question of whether these gifted individuals are more, or less, than human.</p>

<p>Fair warning: it&rsquo;s a dark novel. Whether &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; refers to EOs, regular humans, or particular individuals remains an open question, but the novel offers plenty of viciousness in a variety of forms. But throughout the viciousness winds a tiny thread of hope that second chances are possible, which is what hooked me in the narrative more than anything else.</p>

<p>The sequel, <em>Vengeful</em>, comes out in September, and I will definitely be reading it.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasts:</strong></p>

<p>To round out my theme of supernatural abilities, I&rsquo;m very much enjoying <a href="http://www.thebrightsessions.com"><em>The Bright Sessions.</em></a> (It&rsquo;s four-season run has just concluded, but I&rsquo;m only about halfway through.) It&rsquo;s about a therapist for &ldquo;atypicals&rdquo; — people with special abilities, like telepathy and dream walking — and the government agency that, er, helps them. (&ldquo;Helps&rdquo; them.)</p>

<p>The unfolding relationships between Dr. Bright and her patients forms the heart of the show, especially as Dr. Bright becomes more human, revealing more about herself. The show also manages to balance big stories about shadowy government agencies and ethically-compromised experiments with smaller stories about teenage romance and the quiet growth of confidence. This is what makes the show extraordinary (see what I did there?): not the special abilities or even the unfolding secrets, but the very human stories that anchor us in this alternate version of our world.</p>

<p>On a practical note, I also love that the episodes are relatively short. I can fit a whole episode in when I drive to and from the grocery store, for example, which is convenient.</p>

<p>Plus which, if podcasts aren&rsquo;t your thing, the writer of the show has signed on with Tor Teen to publish three YA novels based on the show; the first is scheduled to release next year. I&rsquo;m exited that I&rsquo;ll get a chance to return to this universe even when I run out of podcast episodes — and I&rsquo;m really interested to read a book when I already have the voices of the characters so firmly in my head.</p>

<p><strong>Post-human:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why the stars in my entertainment life have aligned on the theme of supernatural / superhuman abilities. Thanks in large part to Marvel, we&rsquo;re having a superhero moment in pop culture: their films and television shows range from solid to excellent, and their strategy of recruiting writers like Rainbow Rowell, Roxane Gay and Ta-Nehisi Coates for the comics means that people like me who don&rsquo;t really follow comics are more inclined to read them.</p>

<p>But Marvel isn&rsquo;t just creating the moment; they&rsquo;re also tapping into our hopes and fears about technology and medicine and the future of humanity. As V.E. Schwab wonders in <em>Vicious</em>, at what point do we begin to lose our humanity? And as we see in <em>The Bright Sessions</em>, how do people cope with being different? How do they cope when others want to take advantage of their special abilities?</p>

<p>And as <em>Agents of Shield</em> asks, what are we willing to sacrifice to gain power? To protect others from our own power? How far will we go to stop the power of others?</p>

<p>Thinking about these questions through the lens of super-powered characters provides plenty of entertainment. But the questions behind the narratives are real questions that speak to some of the dreams and nightmares generated by the technological advances of the modern world.</p>
