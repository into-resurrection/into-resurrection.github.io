<p>I&rsquo;ve been working a lot in my gardens over the summer: pulling weeds, pruning shrubs, spreading endless wheelbarrow loads of mulch. And, naturally, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the poetry of Andrew Marvell, particularly &ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens.&rdquo; Marvell is rivaled only by John Milton as the best English poet of the late seventeenth century, and his poems on gardens contain themes of Eden, formal gardens, breeding hybrid plants, the untamed beauty of nature, and the fleeting joy of wandering solitary in nature.</p>

<p>(I know, I&rsquo;m a literature nerd. But I love these poems that think about the relationship of humanity to nature pre-industrial revolution; Wordsworth&rsquo;s nature poetry is lovely, for example, but I&rsquo;m wary of the often sharply drawn dichotomies between [bad] industry and urbanization and [good] untouched nature.)</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48333/the-mower-against-gardens">&ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens&rdquo;</a> the speaker — the mower — complains about the unnaturalness of formal gardens, with their expensive flowers, grafted trees, and hybrid plants. The mower contrasts this with the wild meadows, watched over by benevolent Nature and populated by &ldquo;fauns and fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the irony here is that the mower, armed with his scythe, tends to both the meadow and the garden: cutting down the grass, pruning the trees, exerting human dominance (dominion?) over both spaces. And both the garden and the meadow as the mower describes are imaginary: no gods dwell in the meadows, and nature, hardly absent from the garden, instead thrives there thanks to human cultivation.</p>

<p>Although the mower highlights the dichotomy between the cultivated garden and the wild meadow, Marvell suggests that both are spaces where humans tend nature, their responsibility since God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and where humans come into conflict with nature, their curse since the Fall.</p>

<p>Both the conflict and the joy of responsibility ring true for me, as I find both deep satisfaction and profound frustration as I tend my garden.</p>

<p>I have a shrub by my front porch, and I love the deep green leaves that welcome everyone who comes to my front door. But I also have to fight it, pruning it back every year as its branches threaten to grow over the walkway and block, rather than welcome, those who walk up the pathway.</p>

<p>I feel a deep satisfaction when I clear the weeds from a flower bed, allowing my plants to flourish free from competing thistles and clover. But I also feel a sense of despair, since I know that I will have to do this again, and again. And I know that now the rabbits will have unfettered access to the tender leaves of my new plants. My sweat drips into the soil as I fight nature in order to tend it.</p>

<p>And I wonder: how much of this work is good? How much is broken by the Fall? One of the things broken in the Fall was the relationship between humanity and the natural world; it is now marked by struggle and exploitation rather than harmony and care. Marvell points to this in his poem as people twist nature to fit into unnatural forms. But even so, the mower exists to keep nature from taking over fields and dwellings; the mower, despite his spoken stance in the poem, is an antagonist to nature.</p>

<p>In the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly uses the figure of the farmer in his parables. These agricultural illustrations would certainly have resonated with his non-industrialized audience. But I can&rsquo;t help but think that Jesus' use of nature is more profound: our struggle to both care for and protect ourselves from the natural world is one of the oldest struggles faced by humanity.</p>

<p>I think of the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds, found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+13%3A24-30&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s gospel</a>, where the farmer sows good seed but the enemy comes in the night to sow weeds. When both come up, the servants despair: what are they to do about the weeds growing up entwined with the wheat? The farmer says: let them both grow together. Let the good and the bad intermingle because it can be difficult to distinguish between the two; because rooting out the bad can damage the good; because the struggle can make the wheat stronger.</p>

<p>Just like Marvell&rsquo;s mower, the farmer in this parable complicates the dichotomies we like to draw: natural and unnatural, good and bad, wheat and weed. My work in my gardens is a microcosm of my work in life, as I try to do good but sometimes cause harm, as I do work that must be repeated over and over and over again.</p>

<p>None of this invalidates the work. But our struggle with the natural world, even in as small a setting as the flowerbeds around my house, is one of the primal struggles faced by human beings. We can take hope in knowing that, in the end, the Farmer will separate out the wheat and the weeds. But until that day, we work in mixed ways in this mixed world.</p></div>

    <h2><a href="/2019/06/dual-integrity-ACNA">Being a Woman in a Dual-Integrity Denomination</a></h2>
    <div class="byline">

    <div class="body"><p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/eucharist_2.jpg" alt="Eucharist" />

</figure></p>

<p>The question shocked me for a moment, not because it was offensive but because no one has asked it of me before: what is it like to be a woman in a dual-integrity denomination, in an organization where some leaders do not recognize women&rsquo;s ordination as valid and where women are barred from the highest levels of leadership?</p>

<p>This question was asked of me and the three other women in a seminary course held around the <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com">Telos Collective</a> conference on Anglican missiology and ecclesiology. (The Telos Collective is a missional organization with the Anglican Church in North America [ACNA] that is led by my own bishop, Todd Hunter. I&rsquo;m not writing about Todd, but he is the real deal. After spending just a few hours with him during the conference, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be in his diocese.)</p>

<p>For those of you not versed in the ACNA, two years ago it decided to allow bishops to choose whether or not they would ordain women, and to what level they would ordain women. Around a quarter of the bishops will ordain women to the priesthood, but women are barred from becoming bishops. And this is still a point of contention, with many unhappy that the ACNA ordains women at all. I wrote about the ACNA&rsquo;s decision to be a dual-integrity denomination <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-11-2017-ACNA">here.</a></p>

<p>The man who asked us what it is like to pursue ordination in this organization is not part of the ACNA; he came from a tradition with women at all levels of leadership. I appreciated his acknowledgement of the challenges we face and, even more, the space he created for us to share our stories with the men who have power but not the visceral experience of being a woman in the ACNA.</p>

<p>I certainly had opinions at the time and I did share them. But I keep thinking about this question and I want to write down my thoughts, because as much as I value unity in the church and as much as I appreciate the leaders — male and female — who have encouraged me as I move into church leadership, I sometimes struggle with being a woman in a denomination where some would deny the call I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</p>

<p>Being a woman in a dual-integrity denomination means never being sure whether I will be fully welcome in certain spaces or if I will, instead, be asked to make myself lesser in order to be accepted.</p>

<p>It means knowing that my peers and other leaders in the denomination deny my experience of a call to ministry, and likely to the priesthood, on the sole basis of my gender, not on any actual knowledge of me as a person.</p>

<p>It means not being represented at the highest levels of leadership. I don&rsquo;t have models of women bishops. And, no matter how sympathetic my male bishop may be to the women in his diocese, he does not have the experience and perspective of a woman and so the policies that he and other bishops shape lack direct imput from the women who make up at least half of their congregations.</p>

<p>It means feeling like I have to be grateful for what I&rsquo;ve been given and not make waves about wanting more. And I am grateful for male allies, since they do have power and influence. But I hate that my status is contingent on men deciding whether or not I should have it.</p>

<p>It means that, because I have to be grateful, it&rsquo;s difficult to call out the deeply-rooted sexism that still exists even in dioceses and churches that ordain women. I don&rsquo;t see this in my church very much, but often people think that simply supporting women&rsquo;s ordination in theory is good enough; they don&rsquo;t actively seek to encourage, include, and mentor women into leadership positions in their churches.</p>

<p>It means being made secondary to unity. People on both sides of the question point out that women&rsquo;s ordination isn&rsquo;t a credal issue, so we should be able to let it go. But I am not secondary. I am a person, created in the image of God just like my male peers. And I resent that my ability to serve God as God has called me might be curtailed in the name of unity — unity which is mostly about peace-keeping among male leaders at the expense of women.</p>

<p>All of this sounds very angry feminist, and I won&rsquo;t deny that there is some anger (and plenty of feminism). But I can live and work and seek ordination in the ACNA as a dual-integrity organization; I&rsquo;m not leaving because some bishops wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my (hypothetical) ordination as valid. This space is significantly better than many others, than the churches of my youth that wholly denied women&rsquo;s ordination.</p>

<p>But I also am not going to pretend that this is good enough.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the men who have advocated for my right to ordination. I value unity in the church. But I do not want my daughters, the girls in my church&rsquo;s youth group, or the college women attending my church to feel pressure to be grateful for partial inclusion and to endure being made into a secondary issue for the sake of unity, which feels a lot like being a secondary person.</p>

<p>And so I am going to keep explaining why this isn&rsquo;t good enough, to keep advocating for women&rsquo;s full inclusion at every level from lay leadership all the way up to bishop. I understand that it will take time. But I hope I can see the day when no one is excluded from any level of service in the ACNA on the basis of their gender alone.</p></div>

    <h2><a href="/2019/05/remembering-RHE">Remembering Rachel Held Evans</a></h2>
    <div class="byline">
        <span class="date">May 16, 2019</span>
        •
        <span class="authors">Sarah Lindsay</span>
    </div>

    <div class="body"><p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to write this post for the last week, but I&rsquo;ve dreaded writing it, too. How do I write a remembrance of someone I met once, briefly, in a signing line at a conference? How do I mourn someone who was a mentor, a pastor, an elder sister, even though she never knew my name?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how, to be honest. But Rachel Held Evans was precisely the voice I needed in my faith journey and I&rsquo;m devastated that she cannot continue to point the way, to comfort and provoke, to show the love of God to hundreds and thousands of people through her words.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to write about how Rachel Held Evans influenced my life, so that my story can add to the many others in a memorial to her faithful ministry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost exactly the same age as Rachel: both of us were born in the summer of 1981, which makes us either very young Gen Xers or very old Millennials. Both of us were raised in the subculture of the evangelical church — I could have given her a run for her money in Sword Drills — and both of us, in our early 20s, began to be dissatisfied with evangelical Christianity.</p>

<p>For me, that discomfort arose in the context of graduate school at a state university. For the first time, I was outside of the (very small) bubble of the homeschooling world and the (slightly larger) bubble of my evangelical college. I was becoming friends with people who were Catholic and mainline Protestant and Jewish and agnostic and I was spending time with kind, compassionate, moral people who weren&rsquo;t Christians.</p>

<p>More, I wasn&rsquo;t persecuted or even ridiculed for my faith, as I had been told I would likely be; I didn&rsquo;t need the apologetics I had learned. In fact, it was my agnostic friends who taught me how to listen with respect to other beliefs as they asked me genuine questions about my faith.</p>

<p>In addition, feminist theory was making more and more sense to me. And when my first daughter was born in 2009, I realized that I was indeed a feminist: I was ambivalent about advocating for myself, but when I looked into her tiny, perfect face I knew that I would do everything in my power to protect her from the destructive effects of the patriarchy.</p>

<p>Secular universities, agnostic friends, and feminists had all been presented as dangers (or conversion opportunities) in my evangelical subculture. But in the university, building friendships with agnostic feminists, I began to wonder: what else might evangelical Christianity have gotten wrong? But what would it look like to be a Christian without being an evangelical?</p>

<p>This is when I first found Rachel Held Evan&rsquo;s blog. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when or how; it was before <em>A Year of Biblical Womanhood</em> was published, so perhaps 2010 or so. And she was asking the questions I was asking: can Christians be feminists, accept evolution, even (gasp) vote for democrats? Can we leave behind the legalistic dogma of evangelicalism while still loving Jesus and seeing scripture as inspired?</p>

<p>As it turns out, a whole lot of us were asking these questions. And Rachel, with her humor and honesty and vulnerability, quickly became a leading voice — a mentor, a pastor — among those of us who wanted to learn how to love God and love our neighbor and care about the environment and support egalitarian theology and work towards social justice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one of the many people who kept their faith because of Rachel&rsquo;s work. But she helped me to articulate my discomfort with some aspects of the evangelical church and, most importantly, she showed me that I could seek to be a faithful follower of Jesus even as I rejected many of the teachings I had grown up with.</p>

<p>Because of Rachel Held Evans, I can read Proverbs 31 without cringing and without despairing of ever being a &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; woman.</p>

<p>Because of Rachel Held Evans, I can better sift what is essential (as an Anglican, the Creeds) and what is non-essential (like a literal seven-day creation).</p>

<p>And because of Rachel Held Evans, I haven&rsquo;t spiraled into anger and bitterness (or at least, not as much as I could have). Rachel was bold, but never cruel. She once said — perhaps on an episode of <em>The Liturgists</em> podcast — that she would gladly receive communion with a person who was, at the time, attacking her on social media. She said, simply, that he was a brother in Christ, so of course she would take communion with him.</p>

<p>This continues to challenge me. It&rsquo;s easy, when we leave something behind, to decide that it was all bad, to want to burn it behind us. To want to treat others as they have treated us, questioning our salvation when we depart from evangelical dogma and cutting us out of the community.</p>

<p>But Rachel challenged, and continues to challenge, me to be more charitable. To remember that there was much good in the evangelical subculture. To recognize others as my brothers and sisters in Christ even when we disagree strongly.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that she&rsquo;s gone so soon, that she won&rsquo;t be with me through her words as I continue to work out my faith. It seems wrong and unfair: why her, when she was so loved and loving, when she helped so many of us stay with Jesus even as we walked through the wilderness?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why her. I don&rsquo;t understand why she died so soon. I&rsquo;m angry and sad and stunned. But here&rsquo;s what I do know: because of Rachel Held Evans, my faith is stronger and deeper and richer. And because of Rachel Held Evans, I found freedom and found my voice so that I, too, can help point people to Christ and to the rich freedom and community of life lived in the hope of the resurrection.</p></div>

<p>When I was 20 and spending a year studying in Oxford, I had a crisis of faith.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since realized that my experience was hardly unique; I was in a new environment, exposed to new ideas and people, figuring out who I was and who I could be in the world. Reevaluating my relationship to Christianity seems, in retrospect, perfectly normal in those circumstances.</p>

<p>But at the time, I experienced quite a bit of distress. (I was also, I now realize, in the middle of a major depressive episode which certainly amplified my emotions around my faith.) I wrestled with what I believed; I even tried not believing in God. My thoughts and emotions were a tangled mess and I didn&rsquo;t know what I should believe.</p>

<p>I was in this state when, in late April, I finished my program at Oxford and set off to backpack through Europe. As I travelled, I sat in beautiful churches in every city I visited. Ancient churches, famous churches, small churches, one in Barcelona whose name I&rsquo;ve forgotten but whose stone cloisters contrasted beautifully with the brilliant green trees.</p>

<p>And in those churches, I met God. Not intellectually. Not through scripture or sermons. Not even in answers to the questions I&rsquo;d been asking for months. Instead, in the deep peace of those buildings where saints had worshipped for centuries, I felt God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s peace.</p>

<p>Meeting God in this way moved me profoundly and has anchored me over the years as I continue to wrestle with what it means to be a Christian. But meeting God in this way, in an inexplicable sense of peace and presence, also startled me. In the evangelical (and dispensational) churches of my childhood, faith was primarily intellectual, a matter of believing the right things about God; attending a Christian liberal arts college did little to challenge this approach to faith.</p>

<p>(Plus which, I had absorbed the idea that it was better to be rational than emotional; especially as a woman, I strove to be intellectual rather than driven by feelings. Yay for false dichotomies and internalized misogyny.)</p>

<p>This suprarational experience of feeling God&rsquo;s presence and peace during those weeks of backpacking has shaped my faith ever since. My eyes opened to an entirely new way of knowing God: I still value intellectual knowledge, but adding experiential and mystical knowledge helps me remember that faith is about knowing God, not knowing all the answers.</p>

<p>This may seem like an odd preamble to a post about Julian of Norwich. But she is one of my favorite mystics (let&rsquo;s be honest, my favorite mystic), and I love her in part because she holds together mystical and intellectual knowledge. When she was 30 and deathly ill, she had a series of visions. She recovered, and spent years afterwards writing theological analysis of those visions.</p>

<p>Julian, living in pre-modern England, did not separate intellectual and mystical knowledge of God in the way that we, living in a post-Enlightenment world, so often do. For her, and for many other medieval mystics, mystic theology and scholastic (intellectual) theology were two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Julian&rsquo;s <em>Revelations</em> are theologically dense and intellectually rigorous expositions of her singular mystical experience. Unlike other mystics of her era, Julian only had the one vision — and although we don&rsquo;t know exactly when she finished her <em>Revelations</em> or even when she died, we do know that she lived for many years after her visions and all of her surviving writing is a theological framework for and extrapolation of her vision.</p>

<p>There are many other fascinating aspects of Julian&rsquo;s life — for example, she was an anchoress, a woman who chose to live a monastic life in a tiny, door-less room build onto the side of a church. From this room, Julian could look into the church to see the mass and receive the Eucharist; she could also talk out of her window to townspeople and even tourists who came to her for spiritual advice.</p>

<p>And her theology is fascinating as well: she emphasizes, over and over, God&rsquo;s love for creation, love that continues in the midst of sin and suffering and evil. Julian&rsquo;s famous phrase — &ldquo;All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well&rdquo; — is a profound affirmation that God will, out of love, restore all things and make all things new.</p>

<p>Julian also uses beautiful feminine language to describe God as a loving, nurturing mother. She is not the only medieval mystic to write about God as mother, but the picture of God that emerges from her <em>Revelations</em> is one that highlights God as one who nurtures and loves unconditionally.</p>

<p>Primarily, though, I came to love Julian because she gave me a language and a theological framework that bring together my experience of God and my cerebral theology. She reminds me that we know God in our hearts and our minds, our bodies and our thoughts — and that when intellectual approaches to our faith fall short, God can still be present with us.</p>

<p><strong>For further reading:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The definitive scholarly edition of Julian&rsquo;s works (in Middle English) is <em>The Works of Julian of Norwich</em>, edited by Jacqueline Jenkins and Nicholas Watson. For another Middle English edition geared towards students with extensive notes and a useful glossary, see the TEAMS volume <a href="https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/publication/crampton-shewings-of-julian-norwich"><em>The Shewings of Julian of Norwich</em>,</a> which has the added benefit of being available for free online.</p></li>
<li><p>While there are many translations of Julian&rsquo;s works, I recommend either the translation by Elizabeth Spearing (Penguin Classics) or Barry Windeatt (Oxford World Classics). These are inexpensive translations made by highly respected scholars of Middle English.</p></li>
<li><p>Veronica Mary Rolf&rsquo;s recent <em>An Explorer&rsquo;s Guide to Julian of Norwich</em> is a helpful introduction to Julian, her world, and the major themes of her writing. Be aware, however, that Rolf significantly overstates both the exceptionality and the danger of writing mystical theology in Middle English (rather than Latin) as a woman. By Julian&rsquo;s era of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, significant precedent existed for mystical theology written in Middle English, such as <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> and works by Richard Rolle. Moreover, mystical theology was the one field of theology open to women, since it is based on experience rather than the university studies that were closed to women.</p></li>
<li><p>Robyn Cadwallader&rsquo;s <em>The Anchoress</em> is not about Julian of Norwich, but it is a lovely novel about a young women who becomes an anchoress in medieval England.</p></li>

<p>In the liturgical year of the church, we have entered the season of Eastertide: fifty days — a week of weeks — during which we celebrate the Resurrection. We spent the forty days of Lent fasting and repenting, remembering our need for a Savior; we now spend even longer rejoicing that our Savior has come.</p>

<p>Each week from now through early June, those of us in liturgical traditions will start every worship service with this greeting and response: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen! He is risen indeed! Alleluia!</p>

<p>But what does it look like to celebrate resurrection?</p>

<p>Jesus' resurrection is his defeat of sin and death and evil. It is the promise that we, too, will be resurrected; that Jesus defeated death not only for himself but for all of us. When we proclaim the resurrection we proclaim the audacious hope that God is making all things new, restoring all things, bringing the kingdom of heaven into being.</p>

<p>Sometimes resurrection looks like miracles and renewal, broken things made whole, battles won. It looks like Aslan, light shining from his mane, breathing new life into dead stones, crushing evil.</p>

<p>But sometimes resurrection is Frodo and Sam, trudging into the barren darkness of Mordor with only a tiny spark of hope. Resurrection is dancing in the aisle at at Easter even as you weep for the loss of someone you love. Resurrection is taking your medications and making your millionth PB&amp;J and planting annuals in the spring.</p>

<p>Resurrection means clinging to the hope, the crazy, beautiful hope, that all of this — pain, joy, suffering — is being redeemed, is given meaning by the resurrection of God-become-human, of Jesus.</p>

<p>I want resurrection to be big and glorious, to be Aslan driving back the White Witch. But mostly, resurrection isn&rsquo;t like that. It&rsquo;s small and easy to miss. It&rsquo;s a pot of tea shared by friends on a cold day. It&rsquo;s a sympathetic word for the parent with a tired toddler in the grocery store. It&rsquo;s saying something kind when you want to be cutting.</p>

<p>Resurrection is carrying that spark of hope even when everything is bleak. Not a hope that ignores the darkness, but a hope that the risen Christ will — in fact, has — overcome the darkness.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why we celebrate Easter for fifty days. It&rsquo;s easy enough to sustain this hope for a day, especially a day filled with sweet breads and chocolate bunnies. But to celebrate the resurrection for seven weeks takes discipline and a commitment to carrying hope and Easter light into our ordinary lives.</p>

<p>This Eastertide, then, let us celebrate resurrection. Maybe we&rsquo;re like Lucy, and celebration is easy as we ride, breathless with joy, on Aslan&rsquo;s back. Maybe we&rsquo;re Samwise, desperately weary, barely able to remember anything green and living. Likely, we&rsquo;re somewhere in between. But whether or not the hope of resurrection comes easily, let us speak into our lives, our neighborhoods, our world: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen!</p>

<p>And let us listen carefully to hear that he is risen indeed. Alleluia.</p></div>
