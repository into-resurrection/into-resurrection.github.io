<p><strong>Complete</strong></p>

<p>Complete is hard for me. I could write pages about incomplete: all the things I could do and haven&rsquo;t, or have started but not finished; my inner critic (the gift — or curse — of being a 1 on the Enneagram) often delights in pointing out how very incomplete I am.</p>

<p>So what does completeness look like? Sometimes completeness looks like finishing, achieving: dinner is complete, or my tasks for the day. But sometimes completeness doesn&rsquo;t come from checking items off a list or having everything arranged just so.</p>

<p>Complete is when my whole family piles on the couch after dinner to watch the Great Brittish Bake Off, even if the dishes aren&rsquo;t done.</p>

<p>Complete is when I get coffee with a friend, catching up on our lives and laughing together.</p>

<p>Complete is when I see friends or family I&rsquo;ve missed, when distance collapses and we gather together around a table.</p>

<p>Complete is when I spend time in prayer, immersing myself in the vastness of God and somehow emerging even more wholly myself than when I started.</p>

<p>Complete comes in these moments of connection and times of worship, when I am reminded that it is not good to be alone.</p></div>

<p><strong>Crowd.</strong></p>

<p>I normally don&rsquo;t like crowds: the mass of people pressing around me, separating me from my companions, unconsciously bumping me, invading my personal space. I worry about getting lost, being trampled, losing a child.</p>

<p>And yet, sometimes, it&rsquo;s powerful to be part of a crowd. Sitting in an audience at a play, everyone gasping at the same time; marching in a group against injustice; waiting in line for a new book or movie. The excitement and energy of the crowd contagious, flowing over and through me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s obviously the power and danger of crowds: your individual voice swells to become a dozen, a hundred, a million voices strong — or, in the midst of the crowd, your voice disappears, crushed under the roar of other voices.</p>

<p>Let us pray for wisdom to know when to join our voices to the crowd or to stand against it, even if we cannot rise above the crush, so that we may not lose ourselves.</p></div>

    <div class="body"><p><em>Part of a recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture</a> in which I highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority, our notions of who is &ldquo;in&rdquo; and who is &ldquo;out.&rdquo; When Jesus became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire in order to conquer a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire, he upended our comfortable notions about how power works. But if we pay attention, we see these subversions of power over and over in scripture.</em></p>

</figure></p>

<p>For my first post in this series, I wrote about <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/06/subversion-tamar">Tamar and Judah</a>. Despite the fact that she tricked her father-in-law into getting her pregnant, Tamar is not only called righteous at the time but Matthew also includes her as one of only four women in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar&rsquo;s story reminds us that God cares about the marginalized and seeks justice for the wronged and oppressed, flipping our ideas of power upside down.</p>

<p>The next woman included in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus,</a> however, doesn&rsquo;t point to the righting of injustices. Instead, this woman — Rahab the prostitute from Jericho — challenges our ideas about who can be a part of God&rsquo;s people, subverting our tribal conceptions of insider and outsider.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+2&amp;version=NIV">Rahab&rsquo;s story</a> is straightforward: she lives in the city of Jericho, and she along with all the inhabitants of that city know that they are the next target of the Israelites — the people who are conquering and settling the land to the west of the Jordan River. When two spies from the Israelite camp enter Jericho, they stay at Rahab&rsquo;s inn. Rahab hides the spies from city authorities and, in return, demands protection for herself and her family when the Israelites invade.</p>

<p>The spies and Rahab make an elaborate series of promises, and both sides <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:15-25&amp;version=NIV">keep their words:</a> Rahab helps the spies escape and hangs the identifying red cord in her window, and when the Israelites attack and defeat the city they not only spare Rahab and her family but then allow Rahab&rsquo;s family to live in the Israelite camp — where, the author of Joshua informs his audience, Rahab lives <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:25&amp;version=NIV">&ldquo;to this day.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>From this story, Rahab comes across as savvy and opportunistic: she sees the writing on the wall<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for Jericho and she secures safety for her family. Which is good for her, certainly, and suggests that she thought the Israelites' God was stronger than her own. But she seems more interested in self-preservation than in theology, more motivated by her desire to live than by any encounter with the God of Israel.</p>

<p>In short, Rahab both by virtue of her profession (prostitute) and her opportunism seems an unlikely candidate for inclusion in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And yet there she is, appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy as the mother of Boaz, who himself marries another foreign woman, Ruth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Why might Rahab merit inclusion?</p>

<p>The writer of Hebrews gives us one clue: &ldquo;By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient&rdquo; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11:31&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 11:31</a>. Although the book of Joshua only has Rahab acknowledging the superior military power of the God of the Israelites, the writer of Hebrews credits this as faith in God, faith that God is indeed powerful.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s faith, or belief in the power of God, results in her salvation as Joshua insists that she and her family be spared in the destruction of Jericho and also be allowed to live among the Israelites. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that she isn&rsquo;t an Israelite herself, or that her faith was spurred by her fear of death. She is not only saved from death but saved into the larger community of God&rsquo;s people, ultimately appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And so Rahab challenges our notions of who gets to be part of God&rsquo;s kingdom. To put it one (fairly Calvinist) way, God does the choosing, not us; from another point of view, God accepts all who come, rewards those who trust.</p>

<p>Rahab and her family are the foreigners, the all-too-often-feared Other. Although scripture records no reaction to the inclusion of Rahab and her family in the Israelite camp, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that some Israelites viewed them with distrust or disgust. She betrayed her people once; would she do it again? She chose a new God, but what old practices did she cling to that might infect others?</p>

<p>But instead of being quarantined off from God&rsquo;s people or treated as a second-class citizen, Rahab is instead lifted up and honored. She points us towards the inclusiveness of God&rsquo;s kingdom, a kingdom that embraces the stranger, that transcends our fallen human impulse to exclude the Other.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s presence in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy tells us that we must not assume that a person is an outsider to the Church, to God, because they do not fit our idea of what an insider should be. Let us be challenged by Rahab&rsquo;s story and let us work to reflect in our communities and our churches the wonder of people from every tongue and tribe and nation coming together to worship God.</p>

<p>After an unplanned but much-needed two-week hiatus, I&rsquo;m back! As <em>Into Resurrection</em> approaches its first anniversary, I have been reflecting on where I see it going in the future. I don&rsquo;t intend to stop writing here any time soon — but I think it&rsquo;s time to make a few changes.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;ll only be posting a substantial piece once a week, on Tuesdays. On Fridays, I plan to post something short and more off-the-cuff. In addition to these posts, though, I&rsquo;m launching a bi-weekly newsletter! Stay tuned for info on how to subscribe. This newsletter will have a more personal update, links to great articles I&rsquo;ve read or to pieces I&rsquo;ve written, and (inevitably) a book or two to add to your TBR pile.</p>

<p>And what, you ask, will I be doing in all my spare time? Excellent question!</p>

<p>I am now working part-time for my church, as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministry  and as Communications Coordinator. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be on staff because I love my new colleagues and because I&rsquo;m happy to turn my administrative skills to good use.</p>

<p>But the other reason I&rsquo;m excited to be on staff at my church is that I&rsquo;m in the process of exploring a call to pastoral ministry — specifically, the priesthood.</p>

<p>Whew. Saying that out loud is still so strange to me.</p>

<p>When I decided to resign my teaching position 20 months ago, I never could have imagined that pastoral ministry might be in my future. But this seems to be a path that I need to follow for now, and when I&rsquo;m not surprised or terrified I&rsquo;m really excited to see where this will lead.</p>

<p>Also, in between working and writing for this blog and preaching the occasional sermon, I&rsquo;m beginning to write articles for other publications and starting on a book about faith and feminism. As I work out ideas for my book, expect to see more blog content on the place of feminism within Christianity — I have a whole stack of books that I&rsquo;m excited to dive into.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to write about subversion in scripture — Rahab is coming up next month — and about women in Christianity. And in September, I want to jump off from a rather ridiculous Gospel Coalition piece that divided food in to &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in order to think about gender essentialism.</p>

<p>I was in academia for so long that the start of a new school year feels more like a new year than January 1st. So I&rsquo;m excited to go into this new (school) year with a new plan for the blog, a new newsletter, a new job, a new calling. I hope that you&rsquo;ll stick with me as I continuing moving into this new season of my life!</p></div>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about the situation at Willow Creek. I have no special insights, no particular connection beyond gratitude for its prominence as an egalitarian congregation. I was thrilled a year ago when Willow announced that their new lead pastor, the successor to Bill Hybels, <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/october/willow-creek-bill-hybels-names-co-ed-pastors-to-succeed.html">would be a woman.</a></p>

<p>But the slow-moving train wreck at Willow Creek over allegations that Bill Hybels <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-willow-creek-pastor-20171220-story.html#">acted inappropriately</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/bill-hybels-willow-creek-pat-baranowski.html">towards multiple women</a> is a painful reminder that egalitarian theology isn&rsquo;t enough to protect women from men willing to abuse their power.</p>

<p>I would like to think that egalitarian theology automatically creates a better atmosphere for women. Because as much as I grieve for the many women hurt by the actions of leaders in the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to see these abuses as the natural outgrowth of theologies that treat women as subordinate to men. It&rsquo;s much harder when the abuses occur in churches with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; theology.</p>

<p>I do think that complementarian theology creates a culture ripe for abuse. And I believe that egalitarian theology, a theology that maintains the full equality and humanity of men and women, can help protect against the abuse of women.</p>

<p>But the difficult reality revealed by Willow Creek is that no theological system can fully protect women. While complementarian theology can hide abuse under the veneer of biblical faithfulness, egalitarian theology can blind us to abuse because we imagine that this right theological framework automatically translates into the right treatment of women.</p>

<p>As Willow Creek demonstrates, though, someone like Bill Hybels can simultaneously believe that a woman is fully qualified to succeed him in ministry while also, allegedly, treating some women as objects for his own sexual gratification.</p>

<p>In the wake of the resignation of the entire elder board and the lead pastors of Willow Creek last week, <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/08/10/beaty-oped/">Katelyn Beaty argued</a> that the problem is not, at its core, about misogyny or sexual misconduct; instead, the problem is the blindness of the American evangelical church to power.</p>

<p>I agree with Beaty that power is the elephant in the room, and that any way forward for Willow that refuses to address power will fail to prevent similar problems in the future.</p>

<p>The events at Willow Creek should be a sobering reminder for all of us who hold egalitarian theology. If our view of women in the church does not address the power structures — the powers and principalities of the world — that elevate men over women, we end up with an empty theology, pretty words that cannot accomplish their promise of equality for women.</p>

<p>Addressing the power of patriarchy is a far more difficult task than inviting the occasional woman to preach or even hiring women to lead. But unless we are willing to do that hard work, egalitarian theology will never be able to fully liberate women to serve alongside men and freely use their gifts to build up the church. Egalitarian theology will become yet another &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; mask under which women are still treated as less than men.</p>

<p><em>I highly recommend Scot McKnight&rsquo;s blog posts outlining the events at Willow over the last few years that have led up to this scandal,</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/08/06/willow-your-time-is-now/">here</a> <em>and</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/06/27/about-willow-creek-what-do-i-think/">here.</a></p></div>
