<p>Last week, John Piper once again riled the internet by claiming that egalitarian theology and social practice was to blame for the widespread abuse that people are bringing to light in the #MeToo movement.</p>

<p>This argument is, of course, patently ridiculous. #MeToo has gained such momentum because women&rsquo;s voices reached a critical mass that could no longer be ignored and silenced — a critical mass no doubt helped along by the slowly-growing social sense that women are people, too.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t care to spend more time responding to Piper. <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/me-too-john-piper">Rachel Held Evans</a> and <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/do-gender-roles-keep-women-safe-response-john-piper">Mimi Haddad</a>, president of Christians for Biblical Equality, both have excellent responses that I recommend if you want a point-by-point response to Piper.</p>

<p>But I do want to address the notion at the core of Piper&rsquo;s assertion, that <strong>patriarchy is good for women.</strong> This argument can be found both inside and outside the church, far beyond the reaches of Piper, and it underlies much resistance to equality between men and women.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the question: is patriarchy good for women?</p>

<p>I confess, I react strongly to this question. I resent the idea that my life would be significantly better if I just deferred to men — let men run the government, the church, the home, abdicating my own ideas to follow men. And I chafe at the idea that I could only gain influence at the pleasure of men. The clichés that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world, or that behind every great man is a great woman, may have some truth. But they also reduce women to the invisible influencers, reassured of their importance but excluded from formal positions and the rooms where it happens.</p>

<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t think that patriarchy is good for women. It reduces women — reduces me — to the eternal supporting role. And then it has the nerve to tell us that this supporting role is for our own good because we couldn&rsquo;t possible handle the lead.</p>

<p>But maybe this is just me being an emotional woman, upset over something I don&rsquo;t actually understand. So let&rsquo;s think about how patriarchy has protected women throughout history:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from that pesky business of owning property. Who wants independent means of support if they can hope that their husband, son or brother will provide it?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the horror of studying the nude male body. Women artists of the Renaissance may have wanted to paint or sculpt highly prized nudes like a Michelangelo or a Donatello, but what woman wants to endure the horror of anatomy lessons?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected early modern women from the rigors of studying rhetoric. Why should women concern themselves with the art of persuasive speech, when important topics like politics are too taxing for them to contemplate?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the danger of running marathons. After all, who wants their uterus to fall out because of all that running?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the responsibilities of leadership in the church. What woman wants to risk becoming an Eve (or worse, a Jezebel) because she thinks that she is just as much a member of the body of Christ as a man?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Patriarchy claims that it protects women. But often what it protects is not real women, with emotions and talents and passions and fascinating things to say and create, but an idealized image of womanhood. This idealized woman protected by patriarchy ought to be grateful, submissive and supportive. She certainly doesn&rsquo;t question why she must follow rather than lead. And she never attempts to upstage men by growing wealthy or leading countries or setting athletic records.</p>

<p>Women who can fit themselves into this mold of idealized womanhood do benefit from patriarchy. They often get to exert influence, bask in reflected glory, and enjoy other social benefits of fitting the ideal.</p>

<p>But they do this by denying their own talents and desires, and the influence they have depends upon the men who grant it rather than their own intelligence or effort.</p>

<p>And where does this system leave the women who do not, by choice or circumstance, fit into the idealized model of womanhood?</p>

<p>If we look at history, over and over again we see that patriarchy only protects the women it deems valuable. Poor women seldom fit this view, or sex workers; women of color rarely see the same &ldquo;protections&rdquo; that white women do. Marginalized women don&rsquo;t benefit from patriarchy because they, by their marginalized status, cannot be ideal women.</p>

<p>So a medieval knight could rape a peasant woman with no consequence. A southern slave owner could whip a black woman and still be considered chivalrous. An Alabama lawyer could assault the teenage daughter of a poor single mother and go on to have a public career as an outspoken defender of family values.</p>

<p>This is because patriarchy doesn&rsquo;t protect women. <strong>Patriarchy protects men.</strong></p>

<p>I imagine that people like John Piper would argue that sin has twisted patriarchy: it should protect women, but instead sinful men misuse it. And I&rsquo;m going to be honest: I can&rsquo;t defeat that argument, because in this view patriarchy is clearly good and any example of its problems is evidence of sin, not a problem with patriarchy. This stance is like a conspiracy theory in that any argument against it ends up twisted to support it.</p>

<p>But the multitude of ways in which patriarchy hurts people (men as well as women, although that&rsquo;s a subject for another post), points to patriarchy itself being the sin.</p></div>

<p>Can we talk about <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> for a while?</p>

<p>My husband and I are re-watching the series and finding that, for the most part, it still holds up 20 years later. We last watched the series eight years ago, I think, when my oldest was a nursing baby who never slept and I still identified with Buffy, or maybe Willow in her glorious nerdiness.</p>

<p>This time around, I&rsquo;ve decided that I want to be Giles when I grow up: fond of the children, proud of what they can do and who they are becoming, but a bit exhausted by their youthful energy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still one of my favorite shows, even with some uneven episodes (don&rsquo;t do drugs, kids, or you might turn into an ugly fish monster!). The great episodes — &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; &ldquo;Becoming,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Body&rdquo; — distill our hopes and fears into poignant moments that defy simplistic resolution.</p>

<p>But watching in an era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, and after the piece written by Whedon&rsquo;s ex-wife Kai Cole about <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/joss-whedon-feminist-hypocrite-infidelity-affairs-ex-wife-kai-cole-says/">his serial infidelities</a>, I want to talk about Buffy and sex.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Specifically, I want to talk about Buffy&rsquo;s positioning as the virgin to Faith&rsquo;s whore and the many ways in which Buffy is punished for her sexuality.</p>

<p>(Major plot spoilers ahead, if that still matters after 20 years.)</p>

<p>Buffy, despite all her teenage habits that irritate her watcher Giles, is the golden slayer. Blond, bronzed, young, smart and supernaturally strong, she represents the revenge of the vapid cheerleader who dies in horror films: she&rsquo;s the one who scares the monsters. But she&rsquo;s also a good person: a good daughter, good friend,  a good person who does what she must even when it&rsquo;s hard, something firmly established with her first death in the season 1 finale.</p>

<p><figure class="float-right">
<img src="/assets/blog_images/Buffy_Angel.jpg" alt="Buffy and Angel" />

<p></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>But her sexuality sits uneasily alongside these other characteristics, as we see first with Angel and then even more sharply with the arrival of Faith. Most clearly, Buffy is punished for her emerging sexuality when she sleeps with Angel: he literally loses his soul and becomes evil. Buffy&rsquo;s first time results in the death of multiple people, including Giles' love interest Jenny Calendar, and ultimately requires Buffy to send Angel into a horrific demon dimension from which he may never return.</p>

<p>Talk about an abstinence-promoting message.</p>

<p>This arc with Angel/Angelus sets Buffy up as the virginal slayer who cannot express her sexuality without causing harm to those around her. And throughout season 3, as the sexual tension mounts between Buffy and Angel, Faith&rsquo;s sensuality contrasts the restraint that Buffy must show to prevent Angel from once again losing his soul. Buffy&rsquo;s ability to control her sexual desire for Angel marks her as good, even as it causes her pain and distress.</p>

<p>Faith is Buffy&rsquo;s shadow: another slayer, but one whose dark hair and wardrobe signal her separation from Buffy&rsquo;s preppy skirts and halter tops in summery tones. And beyond her fashion choices and bad-girl vibe, Faith&rsquo;s sensuality also separates her from Buffy. Faith flirts, has casual sexual encounters, and explicitly links slaying and sex. She&rsquo;s the bad girl, the opposite of Buffy in her edgy wardrobe, her questionable ethics, and her pronounced sexuality.</p>

<p>As the virgin in this virgin/whore dichotomy between the two slayers, it&rsquo;s thus not surprising that Buffy is punished for her sexuality. (I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; loosely to indicate the trope of the woman whose sexuality stays within socially-approved boundaries; in the <em>Buffyverse,</em> that means sex within a committed relationship but never with Angel.) But it&rsquo;s still a problematic dynamic.</p>

<p>This is where it gets tricky as a Christian to critique the sexual ethic in <em>Buffy:</em> I agree that sexual restraint is a good thing; I also agree that sex is an intimate activity that should take place in a loving and committed relationship. But at the same time, sexual desire is part of human nature. To punish Buffy for her sexuality suggests that there is no good way for Buffy to be a sexual being; she cannot be both the golden slayer and a woman who desires sexual intimacy in committed relationships. This tension diminishes Buffy&rsquo;s personhood.</p>

<p>If Buffy&rsquo;s relationship with Angel was the only one where she is punished for her sexuality, I would chalk it up to the inherent drama of a star-crossed romance between vampire and vampire slayer, not a reiteration of the tired virgin/whore dynamic that shames and punishes women for their sexuality.</p>

<p>But when Buffy goes off to college, her first post-Angel sexual encounter is a disaster. She falls for the soulful, smooth-talking Parker who is so, so sorry that Buffy thought they had anything more than a momentary physical connection. Certainly Parker is portrayed as a jerk — but Buffy also comes across as naive. The tone of the brief Parker arc is that guys will be seductive jerks, but Buffy should have been smart enough to see through him.</p>

<p><figure class="float-left">

<p></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And then comes Riley. Oh, Riley of the unfortunate early-aughts haircut. In some ways, Buffy&rsquo;s relationship with Riley is the first time she can be sexual without losing her standing as the virgin of the trope. Riley is a good Iowa farm-boy-turned-loyal-soldier who genuinely cares for Buffy and is a much more age- and species-appropriate match than Angel.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>Over the course of their arc, Buffy ruins Riley&rsquo;s life. Not directly. But she causes him to lose his job, his identity as a good soldier, his chance to become an enhanced super-soldier. She threatens his masculinity with her strength and with her previous relationship with Angel. She undermines his sense of self. It isn&rsquo;t all bad, of course; working for the Initiative wouldn&rsquo;t have been sustainable for Riley long-term, anyway. But she upends Riley&rsquo;s life while he barely affects hers.</p>

<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s the season 4 episode in which Buffy and Riley&rsquo;s sexual desire releases a hoard of angry, horny essences who attack a frat party. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a mistake that this episode opens with Buffy and Riley overcome with desire after a hunt and kill; like Faith, Buffy is linking slaying and sex as physically satisfying, and this leads to trouble. It&rsquo;s not a great episode anyway, and it reinforces the idea that Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous.</p>

<p><figure class="float-right">
<img src="/assets/blog_images/buffy_spike.jpg" alt="Buffy and Spike" />

<p></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And then Spike. I love Spike, truly; his arc is one of the best in the series. And his love for Buffy, as complicated as it is, leads to the return of his soul. But Buffy and Spike&rsquo;s season 6 relationship once again portrays Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality in a negative light.</p>

<p>After being resurrected, Buffy has a difficult time reintegrating into her old life. She starts having sex with Spike not because she loves him or wants a relationship, but because she wants to feel sometime and because he&rsquo;s someone she loathes even more than herself. They have a deeply dysfunctional relationship: it&rsquo;s violent and destructive, based on each one taking what they think they want without considering the needs of the other person. It ends with both parties hurt, physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>After this, Buffy doesn&rsquo;t have any more relationships. She ceases to be a sexual being in order to do the work required of her in season 7. Once again, we are left with the idea that Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous, distracting, damaging. Even though the sexual ethic in the <em>Buffyverse</em> allows sex within committed relationships for other characters, Buffy must be the virgin in order to be the ideal Slayer.</p>

<p>If this were a clear requirement, the show could frame it as a sacrifice, a form of monasticism, a dying to self for the good of others. But instead, Buffy is punished for her sexuality until she gives it up. This simply reinforces the notion that women&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous and must be controlled before it destroys the world.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Part 3 of a series on feminism and Christianity. Read part 1 <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">here</a> and part 2 <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-II">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the first two parts of this series, I looked at the ways in which God&rsquo;s view of women aligns with modern-day feminism and also at the reasons why Christians are hesitant to embrace feminism. Today, I want to lay out a few of the ways in which Christians can benefit from the tools of feminism — what does feminism have to offer Christians, especially in an era of #MeToo and #ChurchToo?</p>

<p> <strong>Terminology:</strong> Feminist scholarship has developed a vocabulary for many of the issues facing women today, and understanding this vocabulary can help Christians name the obstacles that women face in churches. Naming a problem is the necessary first step in addressing it.</p>

<p>Terms like representation and tokenism give us a vocabulary for talking about whether, and where, women are involved in ministries and leadership — and whether those women actually have a voice, or are simply present to check a diversity box. Churches can certainly address issues of representation without using this vocabulary, but being able to categorize and define a problem can be useful.</p>

<p>For another example, understanding what feminists mean by &ldquo;rape culture&rdquo; (an environment that curtails a woman&rsquo;s ability to consent to sex while also encouraging men to not take no for an answer) is fundamental to fostering a healthy sexual ethic. We need to identify how unhealthy cultural ideas about women and sexuality creep into our own sexual ethics as Christians, and feminism has the vocabulary to help us think through the implications of how we talk about sex and sexuality.</p>

<p><strong>Defining patriarchy:</strong> Related to terminology, feminist thinkers have spent decades studying the ways in which patriarchy permeates society. This work is essential to locating patriarchy in the church and identifying the often overlooked, but insidious, ways in which it operates.</p>

<p>Christians, especially evangelical Christians, typically view themselves as separated from culture. This attitude, however, blinds us to the ways in which the separation is smaller than we think and the ways in which we accept certain cultural ideas without question or examination. Because patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society broadly and the church specifically, we need all the tools we can use to root this sin out of the church.</p>

<p>Additionally, understanding how patriarchy works will help us to better understand both the bible and other theological texts. Thinking carefully about how patriarchal societies view women will make the counter-cultural elevation of women by Jesus, for example, especially clear — and can also help us better understand Paul&rsquo;s writings about women in the church.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding gender:</strong> One of the sticking points in arguments within Christianity about gender roles is the creation narrative, and specifically the separate creations of Adam and Eve. Some Christians argue that this supports specifically created gender roles; other Christians stress the earlier account that mentions the creation of human beings broadly, arguing that God did not create men and women to be wholly different.</p>

<p>Some Christians may be surprised to learn that feminists have similar debates. These debates may not draw on the creation narrative in Genesis, but they boil down to the question of whether women and men are actually different in their essence, or if those differences arise from our society. The one side, the gender essentialists, understand gender as fixed, with feminine and masculine traits that are universal. The other side sees gender as socially conditioned, &ldquo;performative&rdquo; in the language of Judith Butler.</p>

<p>I personally fall firmly on the side of gender as conditioned by society. But Christians who want to argue that men and women have God-imbued differences can benefit from understanding the secular version of the argument, especially since most gender-essentialist feminists want to balance these differences between the genders with a strong affirmation of equality.</p>

<p><strong>Recovering women&rsquo;s narratives:</strong> Alongside all of the theoretical framework, feminist scholars have done us an invaluable service by recovering the contributions of women in myriad areas — literature, science, politics, philosophy, and many others — throughout history. For Christians, writers like Lynn Cohick have reminded us of the many crucial women in the church in its earliest days; others write about more contemporary women who are often overlooked in the church&rsquo;s stories of giants of the faith.</p>

<p>Feminist scholars have also recovered for the church the apostle Junia, praised by Paul as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16:7&amp;version=NIV">great among the apostles</a> — but whose name was changed to Junias by later copyists and translators who refused to accept a woman apostle.</p>

<p>Highlighting important women in the bible and in Christian history isn&rsquo;t enough to reverse the effects of patriarchy. But if we expect the girls and women in the church to learn from the examples of a David or a Paul, why not also expect the boys and men to learn from Deborah and Priscilla? Highlighting women allows other women to see a place for themselves in the story of Christianity, but men also need to hear these stories so they can make space for, learn from, and be inspired by women.</p>

<p>Feminism and Christianity may seem opposed, but feminist thought has much to offer Christians who are committed to treating women as human beings fully created in the image of God whose gifts and callings are not limited by their gender. Let us use these analytical tools to dismantle the patriarchal sins that harm both the members of the church and its witness to the wider world.</p></div>

<p><em>Part 2 of a series on feminism and Christianity. Read part 1 <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">here</a></em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">Last week</a>, I wrote about how scripture displays the importance of women to God, as women are frequently honored or elevated in ways that run counter to the patriarchy of the ancient world. Since feminism is a recent movement, nothing in the bible explicitly affirms it. But feminism affirms women as the equals, not the subordinates of men, and aligns with the liberation of the oppressed that occurs so often throughout scripture.</p>

<p>Just over 200 years ago, feminism begin to arise a social movement designed to elevate and dignify women in the face of patriarchal social structures. Early feminists, like Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, primarily argued that women should be educated. They claimed that women were not naturally intellectually inferior to men; instead, they seemed inferior because they were denied the educational opportunities given to men.</p>

<p>From this modest beginning, feminism has grown and changed. Feminists have, slowly, won women in the western world the right to own property, vote, attend college, handle their own finances, and work after marriage and childbearing. Most broadly, feminists argue that men and women are equal and should be treated as equals; biological sex alone should not lead to different treatment.</p>

<p>Thanks to feminism, attitudes towards women have gradually shifted in American society. Most people no longer believe that women are too physically frail to run marathons or that higher education will make women go insane. Even in the church, only a small minority argue that women were created as inferior to men; women may be barred from certain positions, but the argument rests on roles, not female inferiority.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite the many ways in which feminism has reshaped western society over the last two centuries, American Christians — especially evangelical Christians — tend to resist feminism (and not only Christians; many people outside the church are also reluctant to identify as feminists). Why does so much opposition to feminism exist in the church? What about feminism engenders so much resistance?</p>

<p>Given the progress that feminism has made over the last century, some in the church (and beyond) no longer see feminism as necessary. From this point of view, feminism is no longer about advocating for women&rsquo;s full participation in society but instead about special treatment for women.</p>

<p>Others view feminism with suspicion because they see the tearing down of patriarchal structures as the equivalent of tearing down society or, worse, destroying the created order. It may be fine for women to vote, but when women out-earn men and take on leadership roles in churches, businesses and governments they threaten the often unquestioned and unexamined social power of men.</p>

<p>Yet another objection to feminism is its association with the sexual revolution and with abortion rights for women. Many, if not most, contemporary feminists argue that women should be freed from sexual double standards and not shamed for behavior that men engage in without censure. And many feminists do prioritize a woman&rsquo;s control over her own body, elevating the woman above her fetus.</p>

<p>For some Christians, these objections are enough to rule out the possibility of Christian feminism.</p>

<p>But I think that feminism is too valuable a movement to simply dismiss. Christian feminists will no doubt differ from their secular counterparts (and even from each other), but feminism like Christianity itself has diverse and often conflicting strands. If Christians can recognize that women still need to be freed from the bondage of patriarchy, feminism can offer the tools to help us in that work.</p>

<p>To address the first objection, that feminism is no longer necessary: feminism certainly has made progress. Discrimination on the basis of sex is no longer legal in the United States; women can vote, own property, run for public office, and open their own bank accounts. Despite legal protections, however, women still face an uphill climb in many of their endeavors. Sexual harassment and assault is distressingly common even in the workplace, as the #MeToo movement is showing; women make up only a fraction of Fortune 500 CEOs and remain under-represented in political office.</p>

<p>Feminists are still working to highlight and tear down the barriers that women face on a daily basis. These barriers vary, of course, based on other intersecting aspects of privilege (as a white, straight, educated woman I have faced fewer barriers than others). But the obstacles women face are real and if women are to participate fully in society we must do the painful work of identifying the ways in which our culture holds women back from their full potential.</p>

<p>The point above is closely related to the second. Because much of feminism is about changing cultural attitudes towards women, it can feel like a tearing down of traditional society. The painfulness of this change points to how deeply entrenched patriarchy is in our society: smashing the patriarchy means rethinking myriad assumptions and traditions about everything from how families work to who gets to speak with authority (and without interruption).</p>

<p>For Christians who see patriarchy as part of God&rsquo;s created order, feminism presents an existential threat. But if we recognize, as I believe scripture shows, that patriarchy is part of the curse and a sign of relationships disrupted by sin, then the work of feminism aligns with our work as resurrection people. Feminism is thus doing the work of combatting the effects of sin, and Christians should be the first to join in this work.</p>

<p>But the third objection, about sexual liberation and abortion, often holds Christians back from joining with feminists in this work. I can&rsquo;t fully wrestle with either topic today, but we need to remember that feminists hold a range of opinions on these topics. While some see pornography and hook-up culture as empowering, others see them as damaging to women. Both, however, want to see women enjoying their sexuality in safe and healthy ways — and while Christians may define safe and healthy in slightly different ways, our goal isn&rsquo;t actually that different.</p>

<p>Abortion is perhaps the thorniest issue, one that Christian feminists must wrestle with. And yet, few pro-choice feminists celebrate abortion; even as they fight to keep it legal, they work to support women so that they don&rsquo;t have to choose abortion. Affordable contraception, robust social services, low-cost childcare and better (much better) maternal leave policies would all make it more possible for women to have their babies. Christians should (and do) also engage in this work, modeling an approach to this issue that cares deeply for both mother and child.</p>

<p>Feminism is a complex social movement, but at its core it attempts to reverse the patriarchal social structures that keep women from reaching their full potential. If we view patriarchy as one of the oldest sins, little prevents Christians from joining the work of feminism.</p>

<p>But even if they can embrace feminism, why should Christians do so? What does feminism offer that a mere rejection of the sin of patriarchy can&rsquo;t? I will turn to that question in Thursday&rsquo;s post.</p>

<p>This argument is still incredibly problematic; while one may maintain a theoretical distinction between a person&rsquo;s appropriate roles and a person&rsquo;s value as a human being, in practicality these distinctions collapse. But it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the majority of Christians who affirm traditional gender roles do not affirm that women are inferior to men.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>Part 1 of a series on feminism and Christianity.</em></p>

<p>Oil and water. Fire and ice. Feminism and Christianity.</p>

<p>One doesn&rsquo;t have to search long to find people who think that feminism and Christianity are incompatible. In certain Christian circles, feminism ranks alongside humanism and communism as a force that undermines all that is good and holy in American culture. On the other side of the coin, some feminists can&rsquo;t see how an often patriarchal and even misogynistic religion could ever mesh with their ideologies of equality and empowerment for women.</p>

<p>Those of us who are feminists and Christians can often feel caught in a double bind, having to justify both positions to those skeptical that they can, or should, ever combine.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I will explore how Christians can learn and benefit from feminism. But before I can get to that, we have to begin with the question: can Christians be feminists?</p>

<p>My answer to that question is an unequivocal yes. I base that on two lines of reasoning: first, I believe that the word of God — embodied in both Jesus and scripture — supports the equality of women and men in worth and dignity. Second, although Christians can dismiss feminism as cultural or worldly, feminism is doing the kingdom work of bringing freedom to the oppressed. The church ignores this work at its own peril.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll be looking at support for feminism in scripture and the actions of Jesus; on Thursday, I will look at feminism as a liberating movement that works to restore the freedom and dignity to women that is so often denied by the sin of patriarchy.</p>

<p>Starting with scripture, the first thing to be clear about is that Jesus was not a feminist, nor was Paul or any other figure in the Old or New Testament. Feminism is a relatively recent movement that began by arguing, against the received wisdom of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, that women are not inferior to men by nature and advocating for women&rsquo;s education and, gradually, other rights. While various western thinkers and writers since the ancient world have viewed women in proto-feminist ways, feminism did not exist in the era of Jesus.</p>

<p>However — and this is a big however — throughout scripture women are treated with dignity and respect, often very counter-culturally. Think of Ruth, not only a woman but a foreigner, whose loyalty to her mother-in-law earns her a place in the genealogy of David and Jesus. Or Deborah, who served Israel as a judge; or Hannah, a barren second wife granted special favor by God; or Esther, who saves her people; or Rahab, or Abigail, or Hannah, or Miriam.</p>

<p>It can be easy to read the Old Testament as oppressive to women, and certainly very few in the ancient world actively challenged patriarchy. But the frequency with which women play key roles in the Old Testament, from the midwives in Egypt to the prophet Huldah, suggests that God values women and uses them to do God&rsquo;s work. Additionally, we frequently see vulnerable women being given special protection: the five <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+27:1-11&amp;version=NIV">daughters of Zelophehad</a>, who are allowed to inherit their father&rsquo;s estate, or Hagar, miraculously protected by God after Abraham sends her away.</p>

<p>And when we move to the New Testament, we see Jesus including women, like Mary and Martha; treating women with dignity, like the Samaritan woman at the well or the woman who poured perfume on his feet; healing women on the margins of society, like the woman with the discharge of blood. Women were the last at the cross and the first at the empty tomb. Jesus sends Mary Magdalene to announce the resurrection as the apostle to the apostles — especially striking given that society saw women&rsquo;s testimony as unreliable.</p>

<p>Even Paul writes that in Christ, the divisions between male and female collapse, just as the divisions between Jew and gentile, slave and free — Christ levels all social hierarchies.</p>

<p>So Jesus may not have been a feminist in the modern sense of the term. But if we read the bible with an eye to God&rsquo;s heart for the socially marginalized and disenfranchised, we find that God values women and honors them, and does not see women as inferior to men. And when the curtain in the Temple rips from top to bottom at the crucifixion, Christ throws the temple open to all, with no more divisions of any kind between worshipers.</p>

<p>Neither scripture nor Jesus require us to be feminists. But we can see that God values women and undercuts the patriarchy that oppresses them, which means that when we work to liberate women we are engaged in the subversive work of God&rsquo;s kingdom that overturns worldly hierarchies. On Thursday, we will turn to the question of whether, and how, modern-day feminism does this liberating work.</p>

<p>I should note here that some Christians advocate passionately for the full inclusion of women in the church but choose not to identify as feminists. Feminism carries a lot of baggage, so I understand this decision. However, the work of these Christians on the behalf of women is inevitably connected to and shaped by modern feminism, so even those who refuse this label can benefit from understanding how the tools of feminist thought can support egalitarian theology.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
