<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/why-liberty-university-banned-an-anti-trump-christian-author-from-campus/544571/">News broke</a> at the beginning of November that Liberty University had Christian pastor and author Jonathan Martin escorted off the campus while he attended a concert at the invitation of the performers. Martin&rsquo;s offense? Officially, arranging to pray informally with students the next morning without obtaining the necessary permissions. Unofficially, criticizing Falwell for his support of Trump.</p>

<p>Although I find plenty of room for criticism in Liberty&rsquo;s actions, as a private university they are within their rights to exclude whomever they please. But their ban on Martin raises, yet again, the question of what the university is for: the free exchange of idea or the promotion of a particular point of view? Christian institutions like Liberty face the even more complicated question of how to engage with a wide range of ideas while remaining faithful to their core convictions.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at a Christian college, then graduate student and instructor at a large research university for ten years, then tenure-track faculty at a small Christian college for another four, I have wrestled with this question of what the university is for, and especially the Christian university. Over the past several years, the world of higher ed has struggled with the issue of how to engage with divisive ideas — a struggle that has broken into wider public consciousness periodically as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/us/middlebury-college-charles-murray-bell-curve-protest.html?_r=0">students protest</a> speakers they find objectionable.</p>

<p>Every society draws lines around acceptable and unacceptable ideas. At the most basic level, societies have taboos — those actions that are considered unthinkable and unforgivable, like incest. But often, what is acceptable shifts: a century ago, talking about &ldquo;inferior races&rdquo; was acceptable; today, most westerners find the idea deeply disturbing. Much of the problem facing universities today lies not in spoiled undergraduates but in shifting ideas about where we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable ideas, and who gets to decide where that line falls.</p>

<p>While the question of who gets to draw the lines gets much attention, I think we also need to ask how we can maintain a commitment to certain ideals in the face of opposing arguments. How can a university balance a commitment to valuing all humans equally with a commitment to understanding the ideas that have shaped history, even the ones that now seem abhorrent to us?</p>

<p>Back in the seventeenth century, the poet and thinker John Milton wrote an essay titled &ldquo;Areopagitica,&rdquo; in which he argues for the free exchange of ideas. Milton lived through the English Civil War, a war fought over conflicting ideas about religion and government. But despite the violence that he witnessed as ideas came into conflict, Milton argues for freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas. He is not naive about the potential dangers; he knows that ideas have power and that wrong ideas can be seductive. But Milton still argues passionately against censorship.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For Milton, people cannot be truly educated, cannot truly know what is good, if they are only exposed to a limited set of ideas chosen by a limited set of gatekeepers. And although Milton&rsquo;s argument was not accepted by the short-lived English Commonwealth, his notions of the free distribution of ideas undergird modern ideas about freedom of the press.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Every society, and thus every system of higher education, will have its orthodoxies and the desire to protect those orthodoxies. And the risk of the free circulation of ideas is that people may be seduced by the evil ideas, or the ones outside the accepted orthodoxy — some of which may be not so much evil as simply different.</p>

<p>In my experience, the university — Christian or secular — functions at its best when it strives to understand its orthodoxies while also giving students the freedom to explore contrary ideas. Having commitments to certain values is a good thing, but that does not mean that we should censor anything outside those values. This balance, however, can be difficult to find; it is thus not at all surprising that in a time of social change some find comfort in clinging to old orthodoxies while refusing to acknowledge contrary ideas.</p>

<p>The irony is hard to miss when a school named &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; errs on the side of rejecting those outside of its orthodoxy, rather than permitting the free exchange of ideas. But it&rsquo;s worth taking this moment to consider the responsibility of Christian higher education: when an educational institution stops allowing dissenting voices, is it still educating? And is the goal of a Christian university to educate or to defend?</p>

<p>I think that the value of education far outweighs the risk of dangerous ideas. But we have to be willing to take the risk in order to gain the reward, and this is the dilemma that faces the university.</p>

<p>The past year has been a challenging one for me. Eleven months ago, after much agonizing, I decided to leave my job teaching English at a small Christian college in Tennessee. And more, I decided not to keep looking for another academic job if I didn&rsquo;t get one during the 2016-17 job season. Five years on the academic job market had made my soul weary, and I even though I love my field I couldn&rsquo;t continue to put myself through that process.</p>

<p>So I quit my job, and when another job offer never materialized I moved with my family back to the Chicago area. It&rsquo;s been a disorienting season in many ways, although I&rsquo;m writing — this blog among other things — and slowly stretching into new ideas about my future.</p>

<p>But this is Thanksgiving, and in the midst of all the transitions of the last year I have much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;m thankful to those of you reading this blog. Thanks for your support, and keep sharing posts you like with others who may appreciate them!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my former students, who challenged me to be a careful reader and clear communicator, and who indulged my nerdy enthusiasm for books and words.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to my former colleagues for their warm and generous support, for wise advice, letters of recommendation, and sour cream donuts from Dunkin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for our friends in Tennessee, who loved us even as we left them and supported us in our move.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for old friends who welcomed us back to the Chicago area, and fed us and watched our kids while we unloaded and unpacked boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who have so generously welcomed us into our new church, making us feel at home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for my husband, who worked tirelessly to set up this website and who has been encouraging and supportive during this transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my daughters, who remind me to laugh and play and drink hot cocoa on chilly afternoons.</p>

<p>I hope that all of you have good food and good company and many things to be thankful for this year. And for those of you who have struggled this year or who find Thanksgiving difficult, may you have a day of peace.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p></div>

<p>In one of those pieces of serendipity, a few weeks ago I heard the Liturgists' podcast titled <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2017/10/17/god-our-mother-live-from-boston">&ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo;</a>, featuring Christina Cleveland, and I read Katelyn Beaty&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2017/october/why-i-continue-to-call-god-father.html"><em>CT Women</em> post</a> on why she continues to use masculine pronouns for God. This question about the language we use for God is one I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last few years, especially as I&rsquo;ve come to see the value of gender-inclusive language in the bible.</p>

<p>For several years, I used the ESV translation of the bible. The more traditional language, especially in the Psalms, resonated with me — probably linked to the fact that the literary chair for the translation, Dr. Leland Ryken, was one of my first literature professors; he laid the foundation for my deep love of seventeenth-century British poets. But the steadfast refusal of the translators to use gender-inclusive language bothered me more and more as I read.</p>

<p>Most egregiously, as pointed out by Rebecca Card-Hyatt <a href="http://juniaproject.com/footnoted-bible-written-for-men-part-1/">on the <em>Junia Project</em> blog</a>, the translators chose to render the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em> in the New Testament as &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; a choice consistent with centuries of tradition. However, the translators footnote each instance with these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Or brothers and sisters. The plural Greek word adelphoi (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, adelphoi may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the translators reject the inclusive language that Paul himself uses in favor of traditional language.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read widely in English literature, and I do understand that often (although not always) the terms &ldquo;men,&rdquo; &ldquo;mankind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; are used to include women as well. However, language shifts; in modern-day English, it&rsquo;s no longer considered acceptable to use &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a stand-in for &ldquo;everyone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; as the equivalent of &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo; But the translators of the ESV simultaneously acknowledge and reject this fact by using &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in the text but including the footnote that the word means both brothers and sisters. The translators choose exclusive, rather than inclusive, language on the basis of tradition without considering how this comes across to those excluded — namely, the women of the church.</p>

<p>So I switched translations, to the 2011 NIV. The Psalms aren&rsquo;t quite as melodious, but I don&rsquo;t feel intentionally excluded when I read the New Testament; that&rsquo;s a trade-off I&rsquo;m willing to make.</p>

<p>Thinking about gender-inclusive language in the case of a word like <em>adelphoi</em> has broadened into thinking about the language I use for God. I grew up using exclusively masculine language for God: God the Father, God the Son, God the warrior, God the bearded creator of Michelangelo&rsquo;s Sistine Chapel. And I do affirm that Jesus was made incarnate as a man, which makes the use of masculine imagery for God even easier to accept.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>Jesus may have been incarnated as a man, but God is a spirit, or a being who defies human categories, yes? If God doesn&rsquo;t have a beard, God also doesn&rsquo;t have male anatomy. And if God created both men and women in the image of God, God must incorporate both male and female; neither male nor female can claim to be the better representation of God.</p>

<p>Beyond the creation narrative, the bible uses both masculine and feminine imagery to communicate the nature and character of God.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> God comforts like a mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+66:12-13&amp;version=NIV">Is. 66:12-13</a>), longs to gather us as a hen gathers her chicks (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:37&amp;version=NIV">Mt. 23:37</a>), and we relate to God as a weaned child to its mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+131:2&amp;version=NIV">Ps. 131:2</a>), among other images. And in the parables about the kingdom of heaven, Jesus gives us the image of a woman searching for a lost coin alongside the shepherd searching for a lost sheep, using both a man and a woman as analogues for the God who longs to recover us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15&amp;version=NIV">Luke 15</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, God prohibited the ancient Hebrews from using images of God in worship; this sets them apart from the surrounding people groups who located power in physical idols, but it also has the interesting result of preventing the Hebrews from giving God physical shape, including a physical sex.</p>

<p>And yet, anyone who affirms a historical Jesus must acknowledge that he was incarnated as a man. Moreover, in the process of the incarnation God the Father is indeed the father. I don&rsquo;t want to push the biology of the incarnation too far, but given human reproductive systems God must be the father rather than the mother of Jesus. Building on Jesus as human man and God as his father, the church has historically used masculine pronouns for God and tended to conceive of God as male.</p>

<p>Envisioning God as male has had the unfortunate side effect, however, of making women seem less fully created in the image of God. A male God combined with ancient Greek medical science that saw women as mis-formed men has fed patriarchal social structures and negative views of women. In order to combat patriarchal structures that subtly demean women, we need to remember that God is not a man, is not constrained to human categories of gender or biological sex.</p>

<p>But how do we do that?</p>

<p>One answer is to use feminine pronouns and titles for God. In the Liturgists' podcast &ldquo;God our Mother,&rdquo; Michael Gungor rewrites well-known hymns to address God as a woman: this is our Mother&rsquo;s world. This phrasing feels jarring to me, but it also opens up new ways of thinking about God. Also, the discomfort I feel with saying &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; reminds me that I should feel similar discomfort with &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo;: neither can fully encompass who God is, while both can offer valuable (and biblical) insights into the nature of God.</p>

<p>In her <em>CT Women</em> article, however, Katelyn Beaty pushes back against using female language for God. She begins by arguing that for every person who struggles to accept the idea of God as a good father, there&rsquo;s someone who would struggle to accept God as a good mother. This point is true, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense as a defense of calling God &ldquo;father;&rdquo; rather, it acknowledges the limitations of using any human metaphors to describe God.</p>

<p>Beaty also argues that calling God by neutral terms — creator, redeemer — risks de-personalizing God, making God an abstract rather than a relational being. This is an interesting point: I&rsquo;m not completely convinced that this necessitates the use use of masculine terms, but &ldquo;father&rdquo; is a much more personal relationship than &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; a term that may invoke a distant deistic god (or perhaps the dysfunction of a Dr. Frankenstein).</p>

<p>Although Beaty concludes that the church should continue to use masculine language for God, while encouraging men to fully reflect God by treating women as equals, I think her most important point is that God is a <em>relational</em> God. God wants to be known by us, but we humans can only understand God through metaphor and image; even the Incarnation gave us God mediated through human physicality.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; podcast, Christina Cleveland rather tartly argues that of course people should be able to use masculine language for God; for some, this is the best way to understand who God is. And if God is relational, if God wants to be known by us, surely God understands when we use language that helps us to enter into a relationship with God — after all, no human language can ever adequately describe God. But if we accept this argument, then we must also allow people to approach God as the woman searching for a coin, not just as the good (male) shepherd; as the hovering mother hen, not just the strong warrior&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best approach is to embrace the variety of images and terms for God we find in the bible. Not every metaphor will resonate with every Christian, but that&rsquo;s not the point; if one metaphor could explain the nature of God and the Kingdom of heaven, Jesus would only have needed to tell one parable. Embracing variety will also remind us that God is above our human categories of gender and biological sex. We may pray &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo; in our liturgies, but we can also embrace the image of God as our Mother.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve challenged myself in this blog post to not use pronouns for God. This feels awkward; I&rsquo;ve typed and deleted &ldquo;his&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; more times than I care to count. But it&rsquo;s also liberating: if God is a man, I can&rsquo;t be created in his image. But if God is mother along with creator, redeemer, protector and father, I can better relate to and reflect that God. Just like reading &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; in Paul&rsquo;s letters, seeing the feminine attributes of God reminds me that I am fully created in the image of God and fully a part of the church and the coming kingdom of God.</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-18-2017-me-too">my #MeToo post</a> last month, I wasn&rsquo;t very optimistic that change in the way our society treats women was anywhere on the horizon. But it&rsquo;s been more than a month since accusations against Harvey Weinstein started piling up, and the allegations against powerful men just keep coming, as if the dam on a particularly noxious sewer has burst. In this past week, we saw Louis CK and Roy Moore faced with allegations of assault and just plain ickiness towards women — and both men are facing significant career consequences because of their actions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not Pollyanna; I don&rsquo;t think that somehow everything will be rosy for women from now on. I am, however, feeling some optimism that we have slowly, painfully and imperfectly cleared a hurdle as years of assaults and harassment come to light. Time will tell. But it does seem as if a critical mass of women&rsquo;s voices has been reached as men are being held accountable for their actions. The elephant in the room has made itself painfully obvious to even the most determinedly ignorant, and it refuses to return to invisibility.</p>

<p>I could vent my frustration that, starting with Harvey Weinstein, most of these men&rsquo;s improprieties and abuses have been open secrets. I could complain about the volume of accusations needed to reach this critical mass, as if one woman alone can&rsquo;t be believed. I could lament the time dedicated to protecting the reputations of powerful men rather than to nurturing the careers of ambitious women.</p>

<p>All of the above are valid frustrations that deserve to be acknowledged. But right now, this has the feel not of a moment but a movement.</p>

<p>So what should we do — and not do — to preserve the momentum?</p>

<p><strong>We should <em>not</em></strong> react with some variation of the &ldquo;Billy Graham Rule&rdquo; — the rule that tells a man to never be one-on-one with a woman other than his wife. The intentions behind this rule are certainly noble: the desire to protect the reputations of both men and women. But in reality, this rule too often entrenches a boy&rsquo;s club environment in which women are excluded from the casual settings — lunches, golf trips, after-work drinks — where networking and mentoring happen. This causes the divide between women and men to grow more entrenched and treats women as temptations waiting to become assault charges instead of actual people.</p>

<p>To be clear, I think some boundaries are appropriate: inviting someone to drink in your hotel room alone, for example, is not prudent in most situations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But a paranoid avoidance of women cannot be a solution. Most people can tell the difference between a man ambushing a woman while wearing his bathrobe and a man having a business lunch with a colleague. Men don&rsquo;t need to avoid <em>women</em>, they need to avoid <em>assaulting</em> women. (Katelyn Beaty, an editor for <em>Christianity Today</em>, had a <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hCw7sk">thought-provoking op ed</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> yesterday on this topic.)</p>

<p><strong>We should <em>not</em></strong> continue to question women who don&rsquo;t come forward immediately after the abuse takes place. Women remain silent for many reasons: the fear of repercussions from powerful men, the belief that they will not be believed, the shame that somehow they brought the abuse upon themselves. Especially when accusations come at an inconvenient time, as in the case of Roy Moore, the alleged victim is often treated with undue skepticism.</p>

<p>We need to be wary of the specter of false accusations, however: although hard numbers are difficult to pin down, false accusations of sexual assault are no more common than any other false accusations, and may be even less common. Over the last month, the sheer volume of women coming forward has made their accusations seem believable. But given the way that women are often shamed and treated with skepticism when they make allegations of assault or harassment, whether they come forward immediately or years after the fact, it&rsquo;s not surprising that women hesitate to make their abuse public. We should not dismiss women because they do not react to abuse in a way we deem appropriate, especially since what is considered an &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; reaction tends to vary wildly.</p>

<p><strong>We <em>should</em></strong> say something when we witness abuse or harassment. This one especially applies to men, who often have significantly more power and influence than women, but all of us can commit to calling out abuse, harassment, or demeaning language. Because much of the harassment women endure is low-level (a slightly too-touchy colleague, a friend who makes off-color jokes, a boss who relies on sexist stereotypes), we must become more willing to call out even minor harassment. Without consequences, formal or informal, this type of harasser has no reason to stop. We need to strongly and consistently notice and condemn harassment and sexist language, rather than simply shrug it off.</p>

<p>Someone here will object to policing language and behavior as mere &ldquo;political correctness.&rdquo; But these days, &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; often means &ldquo;acting with common decency,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s hard to see why decent people would want to be sexist. As a society we&rsquo;re currently renegotiating the boundaries of common decency especially around sexist and racist language, which does mean that some things are now offensive in ways they weren&rsquo;t twenty years ago. But it&rsquo;s not really that hard to avoid unwanted touching or sexist language, jokes and assumptions when we talk, especially since this is the necessary baseline of an environment that welcomes and supports women.</p>

<p><strong>We <em>should</em></strong> examine our own behavior and how we contribute to environments that silence women and enable abusers. Most of us don&rsquo;t actively enable abusers, but our collective cultural attitudes towards gender have caused harm. From a very young age, we condition girls to be emotionally sensitive and concerned for the well-being of those around them; we withhold emotional education from boys and excuse their bad behavior with a shrug and a &ldquo;boys will be boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as they grow older, we feed these young men and women with ideas about love as a pursuit, with man as the hunter of the woman, who will put up a fight even if she doesn&rsquo;t really mean it. With this conditioning, it&rsquo;s not surprising that some men believe they can get away with assault and some women believe that they have to put up with it. It can be difficult to escape these strong and often unconscious cultural assumptions, but we have to be willing to do the work to change the script for ourselves and for the generations that come after us.</p>

<p>Cultures change slowly and painfully, with steps backwards and sideways for every step forward. But let us make the last six weeks one of the steps forward, a moment that changes how we treat women. Let us acknowledge our own responsibility to foster a culture that does not enable abusers and harassers, and commit to nourishing a culture that treats women as human beings equal to men.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a sermon on guns or gun violence.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in God and guns sort of churches (or attended chapel at Liberty University), where I might have been more likely to hear something about guns. But pretty much everywhere in America, guns are a touchy issue due to both the Second Amendment and a culture that glorifies guns and gun violence. It&rsquo;s not surprising that few pastors want to venture into this particular minefield. And yet, as Christians, we need to learn to think theologically about guns.</p>

<p>The political issue of gun control is large and complex, and further complicated by the sheer number of guns in the United States — nearly 90 guns for every 100 people. I&rsquo;m not going to tackle the practical or political side of this issue today, although for those interested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html">Nicholas Kristof&rsquo;s Nov. 6 opinion piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> makes a number of reasonable suggestions. Instead, I want to challenge us as Christians to do a better job of thinking theologically about gun violence. Even when we disagree about gun policies, we Christians can and should have a thoughtful theological grounding as we approach this topic.</p>

<p>The cornerstone for any theology of violence is, obviously, the conviction that life matters, that all humans are created in the image of God and that God cares for each human life — and expects us as Christians to do likewise. But this belief is so broad as to be almost meaningless; it vanishes into arguments about just war or self defense, or claims that the perpetrators of gun violence are mentally ill and thus incapable of moral reasoning. We may all agree that life is valuable, but this belief hasn&rsquo;t forced Christians to confront our own complicity in a culture that glorifies guns and turns a blind eye to the consequences of that glorification.</p>

<p>So we need something beyond valuing life to undergird a theology of guns. I want to suggest three ways to approach this theology: first, understanding the transformation of weapons into life-giving tools in the coming kingdom of God; second, resisting the impulse to fear; and third, rejecting the glorification of guns and gun violence.</p>

<p>Two different prophets in the Old Testament — <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+2:4&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+4:3&amp;version=NIV">Micah</a> — use the image of swords being beaten into plowshares as they describe the coming kingdom of God, a time when God reigns on earth with justice and peace and when war no longer exists. This image of swords and plows not only removes the need for weapons but flips their purpose, transforming tools that bring death into tools that bring life. Further, when Jesus is betrayed and arrested, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26:47-56&amp;version=NIV">he tells Peter</a> that his kingdom will not be inaugurated by a violent conquest but instead by his own submission to violence.</p>

<p>Christians have certainly had many disagreements over centuries about what these passages, and others, mean for our lives. I think a strong case can be made for Christian pacifism, although arguments about just war that allow Christians to use violence in certain situations are, and historically have been, widely accepted in the church. But regardless of our own convictions the use of violence, we must understand that we are longing for a kingdom in which violence has no place, in which we nourish life rather than mete out death. Many Christians see violence as necessary in a fallen world, but we should always approach violence soberly, in the knowledge that it is a product of our sin.</p>

<p>What does this approach to violence mean for a theology of guns? Guns are like swords: their purpose is to kill. They exist to bring death, not life, even if many gun owners never use them outside a firing range. Christians are people of new life, not death, and this conviction should underly our attitude towards guns. On a practical level, Christians should be the most responsible gun owners and should be wary of the proliferation of guns. Guns won&rsquo;t ever be anything other than tools of death, but they can be made safer, harder to obtain, and rarer.</p>

<p>My second approach builds on the first: as Christians, we must reject the culture of fear that encourages gun ownership. One of the most common commands in scripture is &ldquo;fear not&rdquo;: not even death can harm us now that we are in Christ. But fear often spurs gun sales, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/gun-sales-mass-shooting/541809/">now-predictable spike in gun sales</a> that follows mass shootings. The fears vary — of another shooting, of tightened regulations — but the result is more guns and more fear. Christians can reasonably disagree about the use of violence, but we must be vigilant about being manipulated by manufactured fears.</p>

<p>Living in fear leads to distrust and isolation. With the gun issue, we distrust anyone on the opposite side, assuming that they want to leave us vulnerable to harm (which may mean too many or too few guns, depending on the point of view). Brené Brown wrote a wonderful <a href="http://brenebrown.com/blog/2017/11/08/gun-reform-speaking-truth-bullshit-practicing-civility-affecting-change/">article</a> on, among other things, the way we demonize the opposite side in this debate; I would add that our tendency to polarize on this issue arises from fear. In one of his epistles, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&amp;version=NIV">John writes that</a> &ldquo;the one who fears is not made perfect in love.&rdquo; Love leaves no room for fear, but the converse is also true: fear makes love difficult. A culture that encourages us to fear the other (whoever that may be) is incompatible with a culture that tells us to love one another.</p>

<p>For our theology of guns, this means that Christians must guard against fear as a motivation for owning guns. But more than this, we cannot allow fear to poison our relationships with other Christians with whom we disagree. Fear and distrust prevent constructive conversations about guns and gun violence, and Christians should be able to set an example for reasonable, productive dialogue.</p>

<p>Finally, my third approach for a theology of guns requires that we reject the glorification of guns and gun violence. As Americans, we are all complicit in the celebration of violence that permeates our culture, from films to music to sports (and even <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jesus-throw-punches-fight-church-christian-ministries-fight/story?id=25953786">churches</a>). And while the problem of celebrating violence is larger than guns, Clint Eastwood and James Bond demonstrate that guns are often associated with strength and sexual attractiveness. The good guy with a gun is an almost mythic figure revered in American society.</p>

<p>But time and again in scripture, God rejects the glorification of violence and the idolization of the hero. In the Old Testament, God uses the small, the weak, and  the inexperienced to defeat the powerful: David and Goliath, Gideon&rsquo;s tiny army, Jael&rsquo;s defeat of Sisera. And in the New Testament, neither Jesus nor the apostles ever encourage violence as a way of life, as a method of bringing about God&rsquo;s kingdom. Jesus says that the meek and the peacemakers are blessed, not the warriors. Power, physical and otherwise, may be prized by the world, but the kingdom of God subverts these values and exalts the weak instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians should never enjoy a war film or a Bond movie, take a self defense course or serve in the military. But we need to turn a critical eye on violence in American culture and resist the tendency to admire violence. This means swimming upstream against the currents of most human history; modern-day America is hardly unique in its glorification of violence. When it comes to guns, we need to look hard at our motivations: do we intend to use them as tools, albeit deadly ones, or are they accessories to our own ideals of self-reliance, strength or sexiness? Because the latter does not track with the virtues Christians are supposed to cultivate.</p>

<p>The three approaches I&rsquo;ve outlines above are meant as a starting point, not a final word, for a theological framework for guns. All three points can be expanded and their implications on gun policy debated. But gun debates tend to devolve into arguments about safety on the one hand and the Second Amendment on the other. Neither is the right starting point for Christians, and frankly neither addresses the very real legal and social complexities of gun ownership in America. As Christians, we should have a third way, a theological way, of addressing this issue.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all Christians will agree on gun policies. But it should mean that we can approach this topic not out of fear or defensiveness, but in the spirit of peace and charity. In particular, we must remember that guns are tools of death that may be necessary evils now but that we trust will one day be unnecessary. This knowledge combined with a resistance to both fear-mongering and the glorification of gun violence will lay a foundation for real discussions of what gun ownership should look like in America.</p>

<p>Because we live in the hope of a coming kingdom of peace and justice, Christians have every reason to set the tone for this discussion. It&rsquo;s time we step up, regardless of our side on the issue, and do so.</p>
