<p>If you pay any attention to news from the evangelical world, you&rsquo;ve heard about Paige Patterson, former president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) and prominent leader in the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). A little more than a month ago, an audio tape from 2000 surfaced in which Patterson defends counseling women to remain with their abusive spouses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">I responded to this initial revelation</a> on Arise, the blog run by Christians for Biblical Equality, and I argued that Patterson views women as having value only in relation to the men around them. I still think that this view of women is part of Patterson&rsquo;s problem, but over the last month the scandal just keeps growing. Patterson has now been fully removed from his position at SWBTS due to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/southern-baptist-leader-encouraged-a-woman-not-to-report-alleged-rape-to-police-and-told-her-to-forgive-assailant-she-says/?utm_term=.1e8a04901b7c">his mishandling of rape allegations.</a></p>

<p>But this scandal is just a part — if a large part — of a larger reckoning coming in the evangelical world.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has finally opened up</a> about the hurt caused by the treatment she&rsquo;s received from evangelical men.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html">Rachael Denhollandar,</a> a prominent witness in the case against serial molester Larry Nassar, has been calling the church as a whole, and particularly Sovereign Grace Ministries, to address sexual abuse in the church. Her former home church, initially resistant to her message, is now <a href="http://immanuelky.org/articles/we-were-rachaels-church/">beginning to grapple</a> with addressing sexual sin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/06/05/metoo-hits-southern-baptists-patriarchy-begins-tremble">Peggy Wehmeyer</a>, one of the first religion reporters on television, called evangelical leaders out for using the bible to mask and justify their patriarchy, recounting her own discouraging experiences as a young women who wanted to study the bible.</p>

<p><a href="https://albertmohler.com/2018/05/23/wrath-god-poured-humiliation-southern-baptist-convention/">Al Mohler penned a sober reflection</a> on the moment, urging evangelical leaders to view this moment as one of judgment for sins ignored.</p>

<p>I could name many others who are bravely speaking about their own experiences of abuse, pain or marginalization at the hands of evangelical leaders. And there are many leaders, both prominent ones like Al Mohler and ordinary pastors, who are waking up to the reality that the evangelical church is not immune from protecting abusers.</p>

<p>(And part of the scandal is, of course, the fact that many have been warning that this moment was coming — people like <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2013/december/my-interview-with-boz-tchividjian-part-1.html">Boz Tchividjian,</a> who has been dealing with addressing sexual abuse in evangelical churches for years. Evangelicals are waking up to a blaring alarm and a house ablaze.)</p>

<p>Painful as this moment is, the church needs to experience it. The evangelical church needs to lament the harm done to its members and take a long, hard look in the mirror.</p>

<p>And the evangelical church needs to repent of the patriarchy and misogyny that have lodged in the church under cover of faithfulness to scripture.</p>

<p>Some, like Al Mohler and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/amid-a-southern-baptist-scandal-some-evangelical-women-say-the-bibles-gender-roles-are-being-distorted-to-promote-sexism/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e32f6700e29e">Denny Burk,</a> believe that they can retain complementarian theology — theology that separates men and women into different roles and further both requires women to submit to their husbands and forbids women from leadership roles in the church. Some still believe that an abusive husband or dismissive pastor fails to <em>truly</em> apply complementarian theology, and thus represents individual failure rather than a flawed theology.</p>

<p>But no theology that diminishes the full humanity of any person can ever be healthy. Although most complementarians would assert that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, they are certainly not treated as equal in the eyes of the church. This is the failure of complementarian theology: the failure to treat women as beloved children of God just like men.</p>

<p>The problem is not a few bad apples. Better training and a commitment to actually report assault to the police are good and necessary; pastors must have a strong understanding of abuse dynamics so that they do not send spouses into dangerous situations in the hope that one martyred life will bring another to repentance.</p>

<p>But these actions will fail if the root cause remains unaddressed.</p>

<p>Misogyny and patriarchy are some of the oldest sins, according to the creation narrative in Genesis. Part of Eve&rsquo;s curse is that her husband will rule over her: patriarchy is rooted in the curse, along with pain in childbearing and in our work.</p>

<p>Jesus firmly rejects this patriarchy. He invites Mary to learn at his feet. He saves the woman accused of adultery from a painful death. He engages with the Samaritan woman at the well, heals the child of the Syrophoenician woman, performs his first miracle at the request of his mother. He entrusts the news of the resurrection to Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>Paul writes that Christ erases the social and value distinctions between women and men. He works alongside women to spread the gospel. He exhorts men to lay down their privilege, enshrined by Roman law, and treat their wives as co-heirs with them, treat their wives as Christ treated the church.</p>

<p>Patriarchy remains entrenched in most cultures around the world, although certainly modern American women suffer far less than their grandmothers or their sisters in other parts of the world. But the church should set an example by addressing and rooting out the sin of patriarchy when it emerges.</p>

<p>So I hope that as the SBC and the broader evangelical church reckon with their #MeToo moment that they will awaken to the gravity of the sin of patriarchy. I pray that we as Christians will work against our culture and against our sinfulness to see women as fully human, fully created in the image of God, fully able to pursue their callings and use their gifts.</p>

<p>May this moment be not just a PR disaster but a true beginning of lament, repentance, and the humility required to lay aside the benefits of patriarchy and allow women to be as equal in the church as they are in the eyes of God.</p></div>

<p>To unwind from the stresses of moving, my husband and I have been binge-watching <em>The Librarians.</em> The series continues on from the three movies of the same name, starring Noah Wylie as Flynn Carson, aka The Librarian — think a slightly dorky Indiana Jones who collects artifacts to protect the world from dangerous magic. The show, like the movies, has so much heart that the cheesiness is adorable.</p>

<p><em>The Librarians</em>, although set in world where magic is real, completely skips the grittiness that permeates (or infests, depending on your point of view) so much television fantasy. The stories end well; good triumphs; someone can always read the ancient, faded writing in a dead language and solve the problem within 50 minutes.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s feel-good fantasy where nerds are the real heroes, and I love it.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s also a show with numerous references to the Arthurian legend, which means that when I watch it I can&rsquo;t help but activate the academic part of my brain. After all, I spent years of my life reading, researching, analyzing and writing about Arthurian narratives, both medieval and modern.</p>

<p>While <em>The Librarians</em> deploys Arthurian elements rather haphazardly, its use of these tropes resonates with the nostalgia that has always been a part of the Arthurian legend. The stories of Arthur and his kingdom are always stories of a past imagined as better, purer, more noble than the future — a golden age of chivalry lost to the present, whether that present is the twelfth century or the fifteenth or the twenty-first.</p>

<p>But in this show, the nostalgia isn&rsquo;t just wistful; it&rsquo;s also hopeful. Take Galahad, the grail knight <em>par excellence</em> of medieval stories and a major character in <em>The Librarians.</em> In the show he does not seek the grail, but as in the grail legends he remains an idealist dedicated to high moral standards. He makes the world better by simply living, but also, crucially, by training the new librarians. Galahad is a tangible reminder of a better past who provides hope for a better future.</p>

<p>The past that Galahad represents is, of course, fictional: not just made rosy by historical distance, but actually fictional, since Galahad has no possible real-life counterpart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> And yet the nostalgia for a better, if fictional, past still works in the show to inspire a better future for the characters and, by extension, for us the viewers.</p>

<p>I admit that I sometimes can be cranky about nostalgic, romanticized views of the past — and especially the medieval past. Chivalry is violent and patriarchal; nobility depends on the oppression of the non-noble; and one has only to read Chaucer or Boccaccio to realize that medieval people were not somehow more moral than modern people.</p>

<p>And yet I fall for the combination of nostalgia and hope in <em>The Librarians</em> every time. I think it&rsquo;s because the nostalgia is not for a time period, but for a set of values that transcend time. In the show, Galahad, Excalibur, and even the Lady of the Lake stand for loyalty, courage, perseverance, knowledge and self-sacrifice. And when the cast of the show faces an enemy from the Arthurian narrative, the idea conveyed is that evil has always existed but can always be overcome by good.</p>

<p>The nostalgia for the past is transmuted into hope for the future through these transcendent values. And this alchemic process gives <em>The Librarians</em> its big, nerdy heart. Even when the odds look bleak, the values of human knowledge and human courage can still save the day.</p>

<p>Is <em>The Librarians</em> great television? Not really, to be honest. We live in a golden age of television, and many shows have better acting, effects and scripts. But the heart and the hope in this show point toward the power of ideals, a power that stretches through history to inspire us to be better versions of ourselves.</p>

<p>Arthur may have been a historical person; the knights Gawain, Kay, Bedevere and Mordred are connected with Arthur from nearly the earliest written references, although it&rsquo;s impossible to know if they are rooted in real people.

<p>I have a confession: I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what to do with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I mean, I believe in the Holy Spirit. I&rsquo;m just not quite sure how this third person of the Trinity fits into my paradigm of faith. The branch of evangelicalism that shaped my childhood was cessationist, and cessationism holds that the gifts of the Holy Spirit — and particularly miracles, tongues and prophecy — were limited to the apostolic age and do not continue in the church today.</p>

<p>Although cessationists are fully orthodox and affirm the Trinity, in my experience this theology tends to diminish the role and importance of the Holy Spirit. The spirit becomes the odd member out of the Trinity, not embodied like Jesus or clearly defined like God the Father and, without the spiritual gifts, seemingly mostly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been cessationist for a long time; the Anglican Church in North America, my faith tradition for more than a decade now, has strong connections to charismatic movements and fully affirms the presence of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And yet I still am uncomfortable with the Spirit. However, the great thing about liturgy is that, like it or not, we encounter the basic doctrines of the church over the course of the lectionary and the church year.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the feast of Pentecost, the culmination of the liturgical season of Eastertide and the celebration of the gift of the Holy Spirit. Churchgoers wear red, orange and yellow while the altar and vestments change from celebratory white to fiery red to symbolize <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2&amp;version=NIV">the flames dancing over the heads of the disciples</a>.</p>

<p>Weird, right? Rushing wind, dancing flames, speaking in tongues: it&rsquo;s like something out of a fantasy novel.</p>

<p>But as my priest <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/a-preview-of-coming-attraction-kevin-miller">preached on the Holy Spirit,</a> he focused on the Spirit as the guarantee and foretaste of our coming resurrection life in Christ. Over at least the last decade, I&rsquo;ve grown to see the beauty of the resurrection and the glory of the promise that all will one day be made whole in Christ. But I&rsquo;d never made the connection between the Holy Spirit and this work before.</p>

<p>My priest&rsquo;s sermon dovetailed with the book I&rsquo;ve been reading by Jürgen Moltmann, <em>The Spirit of Life.</em> In this book, Moltmann talks about the Holy Spirit as the spirit of life, the spirit through whom we have life in all its forms, from creation to new life in Christ. And if the Spirit is creating new life in us, then part of that new life may involve the gifts and promptings and even miraculous interventions of the Spirit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to relate to the Spirit myself. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of undeniable encounters with the Spirit in the last year that I&rsquo;m still working to understand, and that I&rsquo;m still uncomfortable with on some level. But this framework of the Spirit as a spirit of life, as a guarantee and preview of the already-but-not-yet kingdom of heaven, creates a space for the spirit to work.</p>

<p>As long as I don&rsquo;t have to <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2018/4/19/tongues">speak in tongues.</a></p></div>

<p><em>Ungrateful, she who does not love you,</em></p>

<p><em>yet she who does you judge unchaste.</em></p>

<p><em>You men are such a foolish breed,</em></p>

<p><em>appraising with a faulty rule,</em></p>

<p><em>the first you charge with being cruel,</em></p>

<p><em>the second, easy, you decree.</em></p>

<p>These lines could have been written today, especially in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/canada/toronto-van-rampage.html">recent violent attack of a Canadian man</a> furious over &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; women who wouldn&rsquo;t date him. But they were written by a Mexican nun, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, in the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Sor Juana is a well-known figure in Mexico, but I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of her until a colleague recommended that we add her to the syllabus in the humanities course that I used to teach. She certainly deserves wider recognition in the English-speaking world, both for her literary works and for her engagement in theology.</p>

<p>Sor Juana was a child prodigy who learned to read at the age of 3 and, at 12, begged her mother to allow her to dress as a boy and travel to Mexico City to study (her mother refused). She did end up in Mexico City, however, as a lady-in-waiting in a noble Spanish family. There, she continued her education and quickly gained admiration for her intelligence. Although she received several marriage offers, she chose instead to join a convent.</p>

<p>Becoming a nun meant that Sor Juana could pursue her studies without the obligations of running a household or the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth. In the seventeenth century, a convent was the best option for a woman who wanted to engage in academic and intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>And yet entering holy orders brought Sor Juana a whole new set of challenges: those who did not believe that women should engage in theological study.</p>

<p>(As much as I wish this had changed, in just the last six months John Piper has sparked controversy by claiming that <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-john-pipers-words-should-grieve-men-too">women should not teach seminary</a> and <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has recounted the hostility</a> she faced during her brief stint in seminary. Much of the same resistance to women in theology remains today.)</p>

<p>This is where Sor Juana becomes an important figure in Christian history, and not just a brilliant young woman whose contributions to Spanish Golden Age literature earned her the title &ldquo;The Tenth Muse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1690, Sor Juana waded into a decades-long theological debate about divine acts of love towards humanity. At the request of a bishop, Sor Juana wrote down her critique of a particular Spanish theologian; this text, the <em>Athenagoric Letter,</em> circulated privately for a while, but soon the bishop published the essay without Sor Juana&rsquo;s knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>A brief side note on publishing while female is necessary to understand the reaction that ensued: in the seventeenth century, notions of decorum and propriety barred women from engaging in the public sphere. These ideas excluded women from politics and also made women&rsquo;s participation in any sort of public debate difficult — and publication was viewed as participation in public debates. Although Sor Juana did not choose to publish her essay, its publication meant that she nevertheless faced public censure as a woman who inappropriately and publicly critiqued a man.</p>

<p>The harshest criticism, lambasting Sor Juana for even entering the theological conversation, was written by the same bishop who published the <em>Athenagoric Letter.</em> He wrote under a female pseudonym, Sor Filotea de la Cruz, and urged Sor Juana in the strongest terms to give up her academic studies and instead devote herself to prayer — the proper work of a nun.</p>

<p>Sor Juana wrote a densely argued but passionate response to &ldquo;Sor Filotea&rdquo; (Sor Juana certainly knew the real identity of the author, although she plays along with the pseudonym). In her response, she argues cogently for educating women, even in theology, and for allowing them to write and teach. At one point, she asks the crucial question: &ldquo;My reason, such as it is, is it not as unfettered as his [the theologian who she argued against], as both issue from the same source?&rdquo; Although Sor Juana writes deferentially, she is keenly aware  that many of her critics would, indeed, see her as less capable of reason than a man.</p>

<p>But in her argument, she marshals support for educating women from a wide variety of authorities while building a rhetorical case that knowledge and love of God is best served by the wide-ranging knowledge gained through academic study. Sor Juana argues that understanding history, for example, helps everyone — including women — to better understand the bible.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, Sor Juana&rsquo;s response did not alleviate the mounting pressure to step away from public life and intellectual pursuits. Around 1693, she seems to have stopped writing and to have sold or given away her impressively large library, although it is unclear how willingly she did so. She spent the last years of her life in prayer and service, finally dying of the plague while caring for other sick nuns.</p>

<p>Sor Juana&rsquo;s life reminds us that, despite the many obstacles thrown in their path by patriarchy, women still know themselves to be created with the same reason as a man and still desire to turn this reason towards understanding the world and understanding God. But her death demonstrates that patriarchy can finally wear down even the most brilliant and passionate women.</p>

<p>Women in the western world today undoubtedly face fewer obstacles than Sor Juana. But the church in particular should take sober note of her story and work to encourage the gifts of all people, including women.</p></div>

<p>I&rsquo;m back!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/01/01-08-2018-2017-reflections">January,</a> I chose a word for the year: space. I promised to give myself space to process, space to be in progress, space to be messy and imperfect and uncertain. Even space to take two weeks off blogging while I move to a new house.</p>

<p>I do have an actual space in my new house, though: an office just for me. Even though half the house is still a mess, my books are lined up behind me and I have my own desk and my own cozy chair and my own window. A room of my own, which is making me very happy.</p>

<p>Moving may be the worst — I hate the total chaos and disruption — but I&rsquo;m also very happy to be in a place where we&rsquo;ll stay for a while. I want to put down roots and grow into this space, instead of feeling like I can&rsquo;t take up too much space because it belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>Because, of course, giving myself space also means taking space, acknowledging that I can have the room to take deep breaths and to be honest about what I need and want. I&rsquo;ve spent too long giving space to others without asking for space myself. An office may be a small start (and to be honest, my husband had to push me to take it), but it&rsquo;s a wonderful start so far.</p>

<p>And thinking of starts and spaces, I also started a part-time job at my church as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministries. Anyone who knows me may be slightly puzzled, and it&rsquo;s certainly true that children&rsquo;s ministry has never been my passion. But as I&rsquo;m taking space to figure out my life post-academia, this opportunity for ministry has dropped into my lap, and I&rsquo;m excited to move from informal and volunteer service in my church to actually being on church staff.</p>

<p>(As a side note: I&rsquo;ve been bothered for quite a while that the only position for women on many church staffs is in children&rsquo;s ministry, so it&rsquo;s pretty ironic that this is where I&rsquo;m starting. But I&rsquo;m blessed to be in a church with women in a variety of leadership positions, including assistant rector; this job is far more likely to be a starting point in ministry than an ending one for me.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also just happy to be working again, even if it&rsquo;s only a few hours a week. Writing is great, and I&rsquo;ve been happy to be around more for my girls, but I&rsquo;ve missed being part of a bigger organization. I miss sharing ideas with and being challenged by others who share my passions, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to having that type of work community once again.</p>

<p>Springtime has finally arrived, with a new house and a new job, with literal and metaphorical space to explore new directions and to grow in my family, community and church. I&rsquo;m excited to see where this growth will take me even as I practice giving myself the space to grow.</p></div>
