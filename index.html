<p><em>It&rsquo;s 2020! As I was considering what to do with this space, I had an epiphany of sorts (see what I did there?): I want to get more practice preaching, but I don&rsquo;t have a place to preach on a regular basis (my kids are a less than enthusiastic audience …). So what if I use this space to write a weekly reflection on the lectionary readings?</em></p>

<p><em>So, starting today, each Monday the blog will feature a reflection on the lectionary readings (from the <a href="http://lectionarypage.net">Revised Common Lectionary</a>) for the previous Sunday. These pieces aren&rsquo;t sermons, but they will give me a way to think about a particular passage each week. And today I get to cheat a bit, since I did <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/the-light-has-come-sarah-lindsay">actually preach last Saturday</a> on the Epiphany texts.</em></p>

<p><em>I will still write on other topics; those will go up on most Thursdays — although this week, my monthly newsletter will go out on Thursday, so <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ede0b4433b84/sarah-lindsay">sign up now</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet done so!</em></p>

<p>Today is the Feast of Epiphany, a feast in the liturgical calendar that marks the end of the Christmas season (the twelve days of Christmas) and commemorates the visit of the Magi to Bethlehem, an event that reveals Jesus as messiah and king.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been Anglican, I&rsquo;ve grown to deeply appreciate the rhythms of the liturgical year: rhythms that take us through the story of Jesus every year, and more than that rhythms that build in blocks of time for fasting and for feasting, for acknowledging our need for a Savior and celebrating the in-breaking reality of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>But I must confess: Christmas is hard for me to celebrate. Maybe it&rsquo;s the weather; we celebrate the Light coming into the world, but here in Chicago at least we have months more of cold and dark. Maybe it&rsquo;s cultural; growing up, the Christmas tree always came down on January 1.</p>

<p>Maybe, though, it&rsquo;s because I often find that celebration requires as much discipline as fasting.</p>

<p>A discipline of celebration feels counterintuitive: shouldn&rsquo;t celebration be spontaneous, or at least effortless? But especially when it comes to rejoicing that our Savior is born and lived and died and rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, I think that discipline is necessary. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the ways that God is at work in the world around us, the ways that the kingdom of heaven is already breaking into the world. And so we must train ourselves to see and rejoice in the kingdom of God as it exists right now.</p>

<p>This is where the story of the Magi visiting the Christ child helps our discipline of celebration by pointing to what the kingdom of God looks like now.</p>

<p>First, the kingdom of God is a kingdom for everyone. The story of the Magi is so familiar to us that we forget, I think, how surprising it is that Matthew tells not of Jewish shepherds visiting the messiah — thematically appropriate characters, given that King David was a shepherd and God is constantly called the Shepherd of Israel — but of astrologers from a distant land.</p>

<p>Matthew is, of course, maddeningly vague about who the Magi are, where they come from, and what sort of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; they practice, although it must include astronomy and astrology (indistinguishable disciplines in the ancient world). But this is because none of that actually matters: what matters is that God sent a sign to people in a distant land and, through that sign, they were convinced that they needed to come pay homage to this new King of the Jews.</p>

<p>The Magi tell us, from the very beginning of Jesus' story, that God&rsquo;s kingdom isn&rsquo;t limited geographically; its inhabitants need not be any particular ethnicity. All that is required is to acknowledge Jesus as king — and this is very good news for us still.</p>

<p>Second, the kingdom of God can be found in unexpected places, and in places far removed from seats of worldly power. The Magi, quite naturally, assume that the king of the Jews would have been born in Jerusalem, in the palace of Herod. But instead, Jesus was born a normal child, in a family with no particular wealth or power, in a town of little political importance.</p>

<p>This is good news for us because it reminds us that we do not enter the kingdom of God via worldly power. God&rsquo;s power is not the power of wealth, political influence, or military might — and we do not need that power to gain the kingdom. We don&rsquo;t need to seek that power or place our hopes in those who wield those powers; that is not where the kingdom of God is found.</p>

<p>Third, even though the kingdom seems small and insignificant, its impact is anything but small. The birth of Jesus, although it was a cataclysmic event that reshaped human history <em>because the God who created us became one of us, became a part of the creation,</em> was not noticed by Herod or the scholars in Jerusalem. And yes, there was a sign in the stars — but only a few Magi, it seems, found it significant enough to undertake a long, expensive, dangerous journey to find the prophesied king.</p>

<p>But look at the effect: a group of people who upended their lives to come worship a king. And Matthew tells us nothing more of the Magi after they leave Bethlehem, but it hardly seems possible that their lives were ever the same again.</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t this always the way of the kingdom? Jesus says in Mathew 13 that the kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, like yeast: incredibly small, nearly invisible — but capable of a huge effect. The mustard seed grows into a huge plant, providing a home for many birds; the yeast works through the dough and produces food for many people.</p>

<p>This is where we return to the discipline of celebration: celebrating the coming of Jesus, the in-breaking of his kingdom, means looking for signs of the kingdom. It means seeing that the kingdom is for everyone, that it stands opposed to the power structures of the world, that it is constantly at work even when it seems invisible.</p>

<p>The discipline of celebration is thus a discipline of hope, of choosing to see the light even when the days are short and the nights long. And we can be inspired and encouraged by the Magi, who gave up their time, wealth, and even safety because they believed that the King whose star they saw was worthy of their sacrifice and homage.</p></div>

</figure></p>

<p>Last week, I was listening to an <a href="https://jayshetty.me/shazam/">interview with Zachary Levi</a>, star of <em>Chuck</em> (I&rsquo;m still angry about how that show ended) and, most recently, the DC film <em>Shazam.</em> It&rsquo;s a great interview; Levi talks about therapy, mental health, trust, gratitude, prayer, and his faith. I hadn&rsquo;t known that Levi is a Christian, but he spends a lot of this interview talking about how important his faith is to him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasant surprise to hear a Hollywood celebrity passionate about their relationship with God, but one thing struck me in particular: as Levi described his Christianity, he said that it is &ldquo;closer to Buddhist than Baptist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This line struck me because it encapsulates what I sometimes do when I talk about my faith. I&rsquo;m a Christian, yes, but not <em>that</em> kind of Christian. I distance myself in particular from evangelical Christianity, the strain of American Christianity that constantly struggles with fundamentalism, mires itself in culture wars, and all too often confuses political power with the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>I partly do this because I have theological values and convictions that don&rsquo;t mesh neatly with evangelicalism. But, let&rsquo;s be honest: I also partly do it because I don&rsquo;t want people to judge me. I don&rsquo;t want people to think that I support conversion therapy and screaming at women entering Planned Parenthood clinics, that I deny climate change and think God appointed Trump as our president and might still be iffy on interracial marriage.</p>

<p>I know that the above is a caricature, or at the very least representative of a minority of American evangelicals. And I have no compunction over distancing myself from the actions and rhetoric of that minority of evangelical Christians (<em>cough</em>Franklin Graham<em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>But I did grow up thinking that Christians were being persecuted in America. I was told that wavering on points of dogma was the same as rejecting Christianity. I believed that &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; especially pop culture, was separate from and even opposed to Christianity.</p>

<p>And then I discovered that actually, Christians disagree — have disagreed — about dogmas for centuries. I learned that Christianity is still culturally normative in America (with decreasing strength, but even Trump had to claim some form of Christian faith in order to win the presidency).</p>

<p>I even discovered that many &ldquo;secular&rdquo; cultural productions have deeply Christian themes (hello, <em>Harry Potter</em>) and that sometimes, culture is ahead of the church (#MeToo gave rise to #ChurchToo, not the other way around).</p>

<p>And as I threw off the baggage of the evangelical culture wars, I found myself more and more often making some version of Levi&rsquo;s statement: I&rsquo;m a Christian, but not like those crazy Baptists/fundamentalists/evangelicals over there.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s the line? What&rsquo;s the point where I say: yes, I do believe that, even though it&rsquo;s unpopular. When I say: my faith does require me to take this stand, to reject that belief, to criticize those decisions.</p>

<p>I led youth worship recently, and we talked about the tension between believing that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life and living in a society that embraces, to at least some extent, religious pluralism. Religious pluralism asserts that all religions have some truth, so can&rsquo;t everyone just coexist?</p>

<p>And regardless of whether anyone truly believes that religions are neutral or basically equal, religious pluralism certainly promotes respect and dialogue. (Whether it achieves those things is, of course, an entirely different question.) But that&rsquo;s the rub: how do you simultaneously assert that your faith is True — while also respecting that others disagree for a variety of reasons?</p>

<p>In the churches I grew up in, I didn&rsquo;t learn much respect for non-Christians; the assumption tended to be that they were either too ignorant to see its truth or that they willfully rejected the truth.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;more Buddhist than Baptist&rdquo; approach pulls back from any truth claims about Christianity, reducing it to a personal faith that has little to offer the world and few distinctive elements. Zachary Levi certainly finds strength and meaning in his faith, but it&rsquo;s not clear that he thinks others would as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any answers on how to thread the needle. But I wonder: what if we invite people into the great story of redemption? What if we invite people to taste and see that God is good?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to prove that the story is true. We don&rsquo;t need need to demand that people make a wholesale intellectual commitment.</p>

<p>But the story of Christianity, of God&rsquo;s love for the world God made, of Jesus coming to laugh and cry and sleep and eat and die with us, of the Spirit dwelling within us, is so much bigger than personal feelings of well-being. This is a story worth inviting others into.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not always sure that God is making all things new, righting all wrongs, drying all tears. Sometimes it seems like a story that&rsquo;s far too good to be true. But if it is true? It&rsquo;s the most beautiful story and I want a place in it. So I believe, not because I know that Jesus is the Way, but because I hope he is.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be more Buddhist than Baptist, or the other way around. I want to say yes to God&rsquo;s story and to live as if God&rsquo;s story is true. And more: I want to live out God&rsquo;s story in my own life and invite others to live in this story with me.</p>

<p>And yes, sometimes that might mean that I have to take an unpopular stand. Sometimes it means that I see God&rsquo;s story woven into the world around me. But maybe it&rsquo;s not about drawing lines, about dividing in and out; maybe it&rsquo;s just about the invitation into story about God&rsquo;s love for us.</p></div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working a lot in my gardens over the summer: pulling weeds, pruning shrubs, spreading endless wheelbarrow loads of mulch. And, naturally, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the poetry of Andrew Marvell, particularly &ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens.&rdquo; Marvell is rivaled only by John Milton as the best English poet of the late seventeenth century, and his poems on gardens contain themes of Eden, formal gardens, breeding hybrid plants, the untamed beauty of nature, and the fleeting joy of wandering solitary in nature.</p>

<p>(I know, I&rsquo;m a literature nerd. But I love these poems that think about the relationship of humanity to nature pre-industrial revolution; Wordsworth&rsquo;s nature poetry is lovely, for example, but I&rsquo;m wary of the often sharply drawn dichotomies between [bad] industry and urbanization and [good] untouched nature.)</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48333/the-mower-against-gardens">&ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens&rdquo;</a> the speaker — the mower — complains about the unnaturalness of formal gardens, with their expensive flowers, grafted trees, and hybrid plants. The mower contrasts this with the wild meadows, watched over by benevolent Nature and populated by &ldquo;fauns and fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the irony here is that the mower, armed with his scythe, tends to both the meadow and the garden: cutting down the grass, pruning the trees, exerting human dominance (dominion?) over both spaces. And both the garden and the meadow as the mower describes are imaginary: no gods dwell in the meadows, and nature, hardly absent from the garden, instead thrives there thanks to human cultivation.</p>

<p>Although the mower highlights the dichotomy between the cultivated garden and the wild meadow, Marvell suggests that both are spaces where humans tend nature, their responsibility since God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and where humans come into conflict with nature, their curse since the Fall.</p>

<p>Both the conflict and the joy of responsibility ring true for me, as I find both deep satisfaction and profound frustration as I tend my garden.</p>

<p>I have a shrub by my front porch, and I love the deep green leaves that welcome everyone who comes to my front door. But I also have to fight it, pruning it back every year as its branches threaten to grow over the walkway and block, rather than welcome, those who walk up the pathway.</p>

<p>I feel a deep satisfaction when I clear the weeds from a flower bed, allowing my plants to flourish free from competing thistles and clover. But I also feel a sense of despair, since I know that I will have to do this again, and again. And I know that now the rabbits will have unfettered access to the tender leaves of my new plants. My sweat drips into the soil as I fight nature in order to tend it.</p>

<p>And I wonder: how much of this work is good? How much is broken by the Fall? One of the things broken in the Fall was the relationship between humanity and the natural world; it is now marked by struggle and exploitation rather than harmony and care. Marvell points to this in his poem as people twist nature to fit into unnatural forms. But even so, the mower exists to keep nature from taking over fields and dwellings; the mower, despite his spoken stance in the poem, is an antagonist to nature.</p>

<p>In the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly uses the figure of the farmer in his parables. These agricultural illustrations would certainly have resonated with his non-industrialized audience. But I can&rsquo;t help but think that Jesus' use of nature is more profound: our struggle to both care for and protect ourselves from the natural world is one of the oldest struggles faced by humanity.</p>

<p>I think of the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds, found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+13%3A24-30&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s gospel</a>, where the farmer sows good seed but the enemy comes in the night to sow weeds. When both come up, the servants despair: what are they to do about the weeds growing up entwined with the wheat? The farmer says: let them both grow together. Let the good and the bad intermingle because it can be difficult to distinguish between the two; because rooting out the bad can damage the good; because the struggle can make the wheat stronger.</p>

<p>Just like Marvell&rsquo;s mower, the farmer in this parable complicates the dichotomies we like to draw: natural and unnatural, good and bad, wheat and weed. My work in my gardens is a microcosm of my work in life, as I try to do good but sometimes cause harm, as I do work that must be repeated over and over and over again.</p>

<p>None of this invalidates the work. But our struggle with the natural world, even in as small a setting as the flowerbeds around my house, is one of the primal struggles faced by human beings. We can take hope in knowing that, in the end, the Farmer will separate out the wheat and the weeds. But until that day, we work in mixed ways in this mixed world.</p></div>

</figure></p>

<p>The question shocked me for a moment, not because it was offensive but because no one has asked it of me before: what is it like to be a woman in a dual-integrity denomination, in an organization where some leaders do not recognize women&rsquo;s ordination as valid and where women are barred from the highest levels of leadership?</p>

<p>This question was asked of me and the three other women in a seminary course held around the <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com">Telos Collective</a> conference on Anglican missiology and ecclesiology. (The Telos Collective is a missional organization with the Anglican Church in North America [ACNA] that is led by my own bishop, Todd Hunter. I&rsquo;m not writing about Todd, but he is the real deal. After spending just a few hours with him during the conference, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be in his diocese.)</p>

<p>For those of you not versed in the ACNA, two years ago it decided to allow bishops to choose whether or not they would ordain women, and to what level they would ordain women. Around a quarter of the bishops will ordain women to the priesthood, but women are barred from becoming bishops. And this is still a point of contention, with many unhappy that the ACNA ordains women at all. I wrote about the ACNA&rsquo;s decision to be a dual-integrity denomination <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-11-2017-ACNA">here.</a></p>

<p>The man who asked us what it is like to pursue ordination in this organization is not part of the ACNA; he came from a tradition with women at all levels of leadership. I appreciated his acknowledgement of the challenges we face and, even more, the space he created for us to share our stories with the men who have power but not the visceral experience of being a woman in the ACNA.</p>

<p>I certainly had opinions at the time and I did share them. But I keep thinking about this question and I want to write down my thoughts, because as much as I value unity in the church and as much as I appreciate the leaders — male and female — who have encouraged me as I move into church leadership, I sometimes struggle with being a woman in a denomination where some would deny the call I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</p>

<p>Being a woman in a dual-integrity denomination means never being sure whether I will be fully welcome in certain spaces or if I will, instead, be asked to make myself lesser in order to be accepted.</p>

<p>It means knowing that my peers and other leaders in the denomination deny my experience of a call to ministry, and likely to the priesthood, on the sole basis of my gender, not on any actual knowledge of me as a person.</p>

<p>It means not being represented at the highest levels of leadership. I don&rsquo;t have models of women bishops. And, no matter how sympathetic my male bishop may be to the women in his diocese, he does not have the experience and perspective of a woman and so the policies that he and other bishops shape lack direct imput from the women who make up at least half of their congregations.</p>

<p>It means feeling like I have to be grateful for what I&rsquo;ve been given and not make waves about wanting more. And I am grateful for male allies, since they do have power and influence. But I hate that my status is contingent on men deciding whether or not I should have it.</p>

<p>It means that, because I have to be grateful, it&rsquo;s difficult to call out the deeply-rooted sexism that still exists even in dioceses and churches that ordain women. I don&rsquo;t see this in my church very much, but often people think that simply supporting women&rsquo;s ordination in theory is good enough; they don&rsquo;t actively seek to encourage, include, and mentor women into leadership positions in their churches.</p>

<p>It means being made secondary to unity. People on both sides of the question point out that women&rsquo;s ordination isn&rsquo;t a credal issue, so we should be able to let it go. But I am not secondary. I am a person, created in the image of God just like my male peers. And I resent that my ability to serve God as God has called me might be curtailed in the name of unity — unity which is mostly about peace-keeping among male leaders at the expense of women.</p>

<p>All of this sounds very angry feminist, and I won&rsquo;t deny that there is some anger (and plenty of feminism). But I can live and work and seek ordination in the ACNA as a dual-integrity organization; I&rsquo;m not leaving because some bishops wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my (hypothetical) ordination as valid. This space is significantly better than many others, than the churches of my youth that wholly denied women&rsquo;s ordination.</p>

<p>But I also am not going to pretend that this is good enough.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the men who have advocated for my right to ordination. I value unity in the church. But I do not want my daughters, the girls in my church&rsquo;s youth group, or the college women attending my church to feel pressure to be grateful for partial inclusion and to endure being made into a secondary issue for the sake of unity, which feels a lot like being a secondary person.</p>

<p>And so I am going to keep explaining why this isn&rsquo;t good enough, to keep advocating for women&rsquo;s full inclusion at every level from lay leadership all the way up to bishop. I understand that it will take time. But I hope I can see the day when no one is excluded from any level of service in the ACNA on the basis of their gender alone.</p></div>
