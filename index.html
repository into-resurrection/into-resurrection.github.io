<p><em>Part 2 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a></em></p>

<p>Several years ago, my husband and I were part of a small group that watched <em>The Truth Project</em>, a video series produced by Focus on the Family. I have plenty of varied critiques of the material, but one phrase — often repeated by the main presenter — has stuck with me: he asked what the world would look like if we &ldquo;really believed&rdquo; what we claim to believe.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the phrase is that earnest mental commitment to a set of beliefs will, inevitably, change the way we live. But notice the emphasis: we need to work harder to <strong>believe</strong> the right things, to &ldquo;really&rdquo; believe. The orthodoxy (right beliefs) must, in this view, precede the orthopraxy (right doing).</p>

<p>But what does that mean? And why so much emphasis on our mental state?</p>

<p>Protestant theology in particular has a history of emphasizing salvation by grace through faith, rather than through works (although orthodox Christianity in all forms affirms that only Christ can bring about salvation). Additionally, Protestant theology was deeply entwined with Renaissance humanism, the sweeping intellectual movement running alongside the Reformation.</p>

<p>This intellectual grounding, plus a desire to avoid works-based theologies, meshed with the ever-present Platonism of western culture that values the mind (the metaphysical) over the body (the physical). And this results in a strain of Christianity that emphasizes right thinking, right believing, over all else.</p>

<p>In this vision of Christianity, the most crucial thing is to have the right mental furniture arranged in the right mental order. No papers scattered on the coffee table, no comfy but ugly couches, no chairs sitting askew; our intellectual house must be in order.</p>

<p>I confess, I like tidy mental systems and neat intellectual arguments; I want my mental faith furniture to have good feng shui, if I may be permitted a mixed metaphor. Clearly, what we believe shapes how we live in significant ways.</p>

<p>And yet. Can Christianity really be primarily about mental furniture? About the strength of our intellectual beliefs?</p>

<p>I think that the Incarnation gives a resounding NO to that question. God&rsquo;s great love for us was not only spiritual or metaphysical: love took on human flesh, <em>suffering</em> human flesh, in the person of Jesus Christ. Love became incarnate, became tangible, carried by a poor teenage girl and born in the lowliest of places. If the greatest expression of God&rsquo;s love required a human body, how can we return and reflect that love apart from our bodies?</p>

<p>One of the most sobering passages in the bible is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. Here, Jesus envisions final judgment, saying to the righteous:</p>

<blockquote><p>For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p></blockquote>

<p>James tells us that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14-26&amp;version=NIV">faith without works is dead</a>; Paul tells us that all the spiritual accomplishments in the world <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">are nothing without love</a>. We can really believe all we want, but until that belief becomes love and takes on flesh, becoming embodied in the world, all that belief is meaningless. The intellectual furniture matters only inasmuch as it becomes embodied in food for the hungry, clothes for the needy, company for the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> believe in God all the time. Some days, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to look at the wrongs of the world and believe that a good God is somehow present. Some days, the hope of resurrection seems like a beautiful but impossible dream. Some days, my prayers hover in the corner of my ceiling and seem to vanish into nothingness.</p>

<p>But forcing myself into some sort of intellectual certainty doesn&rsquo;t help on those days. What helps? Drinking coffee with a friend. Cuddling with a blanket, a book, and a child. Taking a meal to new parents. Opening my home to giggling 8-year-olds and their math homework. Volunteering with an organization that helps the hurting. Jesus tells us to love God and love others: how can we do that if we don&rsquo;t embody love, incarnate love?</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s love became a man, became a body, became relationships and shared tears and physical touch, broken bread and blood spilled out like wine. Our theology must reflect this, must include the body as well as the mind.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Paul, if I have the most perfectly arranged mental furniture but I never turn those beliefs into action, I have nothing. If the greatest love of all must become flesh, how can I respond except by incarnating my love in physical actions?</p></div>

<p><em>Part 1 of an Advent series on incarnation.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday began the season of Advent, the weeks of anticipation and longing leading up to the celebration of Christmas. In these days before Christmas we recall the longing for the Messiah, fulfilled with the birth of Christ, and remind ourselves that we are still longing for the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. Much like Lent, Advent reminds us that we need a savior — and that our savior has come, born in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Advent is about the longing, about the hope of a candle lit against the darkness. It&rsquo;s also about the fact that Christ has come, that he was born to a woman in a particular time and place, that God dwelt amongst humanity. Advent is about incarnation: both the Incarnation, God become human, and incarnation, the fact of our physical bodies and the longing for the restoration of God&rsquo;s very good creation.</p>

<p>When we sing about sweet baby Jesus, silent in the manger, or when we set up our sanitized nativities, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the breathtaking reality of incarnation. Not only did God become a human being, but God did so in the most messy, most human way possible: childbirth.</p>

<p>What a breathtaking affirmation of the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<p>In my experience, we modern western Christians are not particularly good at thinking about the material creation. We are heirs not just to Christianity but also to Plato — whose articulation of the separation between the illusory material world and real world of ideal forms undergirds centuries of philosophy. Plato&rsquo;s conception of a reality beyond the material world meshes in many ways with Christianity, but with the unfortunate side effect of elevating the spiritual above the physical.</p>

<p>Elevating the spiritual or metaphysical over the material or physical is especially easy because of the way that sin has marred the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation. We develop arthritis, catch colds, fight cancer, experience heart failure. We often view our bodies as limitations, as weights that hold the true us (whatever that may be) back from fulfilling our potential.</p>

<p>But when we denigrate our physical bodies, we forget that when God made humankind and thus completed creation, God said that it — creation, the material world — was <strong>very</strong> good. And while sin may mar that goodness, it cannot erase it: our bodies were created very good, and will one day be recreated and restored to that goodness.</p>

<p>When God chose to come to earth as Jesus, he chose to take on the flesh that he had created. He chose to inhabit a physical body, to experience the joys and indignities of the body. And more, he chose to be born, to experience the fullness of human life from helpless baby, to unsteady toddler, to hormonal teenager, to suffering adult.</p>

<p>God didn&rsquo;t cheat, creating a body for himself out of nothing, or creating a perfect body. And the doctrine of the Incarnation says that his physical body wasn&rsquo;t just some shell, some avatar; rather, Jesus was fully human just as he was fully divine. Jesus&rsquo;s willingness to take on flesh shows a respect for and a profound love for the material body.</p>

<p>The Incarnation suggests that God redeems humanity not by separating the spiritual from the physical but by healing and integrating both. And so over the next three weeks, I&rsquo;ll be exploring what this means: how should the Incarnation shape our thinking about the material world, and our bodies in particular? What does it mean that the center of our theology is a God who willingly became human flesh? How do we live in the tension between the very good creation and the very real physical effects of sin?</p>

<p>The first candle in the Advent wreath is the prophecy candle, or the candle of hope. As we live in the tension between the promise and fulfillment, may the incarnation give us hope that all creation — material and immaterial — will ultimately be redeemed and once again made very good.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Experience, rather than any authority in this world, is good enough for me to tell you about the woe that is marriage&rdquo;: so proclaims Chaucer&rsquo;s vivacious Wife of Bath in the opening lines of her <em>Prologue</em> in the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. She frames the conflict between experience and authority vividly as she contrasts her wide-ranging marital experience (five husbands) with the academic theological authorities on women and marriage. Although her concerns differ in some ways from ours today, the tension between her lived experience and the authoritative thinking on femininity remains familiar to women.</p>

<p>As the allegations of sexual assault and harassment keep rolling in, and more prominent men face the consequences (most recently, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2BvU35Q">Matt Lauer</a>), I am finding Chaucer&rsquo;s 600-year-old exploration of the dichotomy between authority and experience particularly relevant. His Wife of Bath, Alison, experiences — often painfully — the tension between the authorities about women and her own life as a woman. Alison is well aware of the received wisdom about women: women manipulate men and lie about cheating; they care only about their position and appearance; they cannot control their sexual appetites (this last characteristic has, since Chaucer&rsquo;s day, switched from women to men).</p>

<p>And the Wife of Bath doesn&rsquo;t deny this received wisdom, exactly. She brags about how she manipulated her first three husbands, all elderly and rich, in order to gain wealth — while lying about her extramarital affairs. She unabashedly seeks social prominence, gained through her husbands' wealth. And she openly pursues her own sexual satisfaction in her fifth marriage.</p>

<p>But while authority describes the Wife of Bath, it cannot comprehend her lived experience. She tells us that she was first married at age 12: a surprisingly young age for even Chaucer&rsquo;s fourteenth-century readers, and an age at which the young Alison was completely at the mercy of authority — parents, guardians, husband. Of course Alison does what she can to gain some degree of power and autonomy, using the only tools she&rsquo;s ever been given.</p>

<p>Authority also comes into more direct conflict with experience in Alison&rsquo;s fifth marriage, to Jankyn — her only named husband. She, wealthy now from the estates of her first three husbands, chooses the young Jankyn because she finds him sexually attractive. But unfortunately for her, Jankyn&rsquo;s hobby is reading the so-called antifeminist authorities: those church fathers who most venomously attack and condemn women as uniquely sinful, the cause of all evil in the world from Eve onward.</p>

<p>In a scene worthy of any sitcom, Jankyn sits by the fire reading these authorities to his wife. She, unable to bear any more, rips the pages from the book and tosses them into the fire; Jankyn knocks her down in a rage. But when he sees that he has hurt his wife, he is overcome with repentance and the two reconcile — burning his antifeminist book.</p>

<p>Although Chaucer plays this scene for comedic effect, he also highlights the interplay between authority and experience. Jankyn&rsquo;s affinity for a certain type of authority leads him to treat his wife badly, haranguing her with readings on her inadequacies as a woman and even physically abusing her. These authorities can&rsquo;t remain abstract: they are inevitably reflected in experience. And Alison&rsquo;s experience suggests that these antifeminist authorities are dangerous to women precisely because they do not attempt to understand how their arguments affect the actual lived experience of women.</p>

<p>So how does this 600-year-old story connect to this particular moment, in which men are facing a reckoning as women collectively voice the pain of years of harassment and abuse?</p>

<p>In our society — both broadly and within the church — received authority tells us that men want sex, while women do emotions. It tells us that boys will be boys — and if you want to play with the boys, you have to learn not to cry. It tells us that women manipulate men sexually and that women lie, so their stories about assault are always suspect.</p>

<p>Women have known, have <em>experienced</em>, the consequences of these beliefs for decades. All too often, however, these experiences, because they conflict with the authority of cultural beliefs, have been denied and suppressed. And it&rsquo;s not just men who do these: we women do it to ourselves when we downplay and justify our experiences. (NPR&rsquo;s Kat Chow has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/25/565729334/gaslighting-how-a-flicker-of-self-doubt-warps-our-response-to-sexual-harassment">a brilliant article</a> on this topic.) Sometimes, especially in the church, we do this in response to overt authority; other times, it&rsquo;s under the pressure of cultural authority.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re witnessing a moment of experience talking back to authority: when we let &ldquo;boys be boys&rdquo; (code for bad behavior), we let them harm women. When we paint women as emotional at best, manipulative at worst, we make it impossible for them to hold men accountable for their actions. When we accept harassment as the price for workplace success, we condemn women to an extra burden of stress and discomfort in their jobs.</p>

<p>Ideas have consequences. Authority shapes experience. And authority that cannot acknowledge experience, cannot adapt when it produces harmful experience, is dangerous.</p>

<p>I love Chaucer because of the way he explodes binary oppositions — the Wife of Bath sets up authority and experience as opposites, but as we see in her tale they are inextricably linked. Chaucer demonstrates that problems arise when that link goes only one direction, from authority to experience; experience should also inform authority.</p>

<p>Changes to received wisdom are always slow. But as the experience of hundreds and thousands of women comes to painful light, I hope it will reshape our authorities on women. Women cannot thrive in a society that suppresses their experiences and refuses to let those experiences reshape our ideas.</p></div>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/why-liberty-university-banned-an-anti-trump-christian-author-from-campus/544571/">News broke</a> at the beginning of November that Liberty University had Christian pastor and author Jonathan Martin escorted off the campus while he attended a concert at the invitation of the performers. Martin&rsquo;s offense? Officially, arranging to pray informally with students the next morning without obtaining the necessary permissions. Unofficially, criticizing Falwell for his support of Trump.</p>

<p>Although I find plenty of room for criticism in Liberty&rsquo;s actions, as a private university they are within their rights to exclude whomever they please. But their ban on Martin raises, yet again, the question of what the university is for: the free exchange of idea or the promotion of a particular point of view? Christian institutions like Liberty face the even more complicated question of how to engage with a wide range of ideas while remaining faithful to their core convictions.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at a Christian college, then graduate student and instructor at a large research university for ten years, then tenure-track faculty at a small Christian college for another four, I have wrestled with this question of what the university is for, and especially the Christian university. Over the past several years, the world of higher ed has struggled with the issue of how to engage with divisive ideas — a struggle that has broken into wider public consciousness periodically as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/us/middlebury-college-charles-murray-bell-curve-protest.html?_r=0">students protest</a> speakers they find objectionable.</p>

<p>Every society draws lines around acceptable and unacceptable ideas. At the most basic level, societies have taboos — those actions that are considered unthinkable and unforgivable, like incest. But often, what is acceptable shifts: a century ago, talking about &ldquo;inferior races&rdquo; was acceptable; today, most westerners find the idea deeply disturbing. Much of the problem facing universities today lies not in spoiled undergraduates but in shifting ideas about where we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable ideas, and who gets to decide where that line falls.</p>

<p>While the question of who gets to draw the lines gets much attention, I think we also need to ask how we can maintain a commitment to certain ideals in the face of opposing arguments. How can a university balance a commitment to valuing all humans equally with a commitment to understanding the ideas that have shaped history, even the ones that now seem abhorrent to us?</p>

<p>Back in the seventeenth century, the poet and thinker John Milton wrote an essay titled &ldquo;Areopagitica,&rdquo; in which he argues for the free exchange of ideas. Milton lived through the English Civil War, a war fought over conflicting ideas about religion and government. But despite the violence that he witnessed as ideas came into conflict, Milton argues for freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas. He is not naive about the potential dangers; he knows that ideas have power and that wrong ideas can be seductive. But Milton still argues passionately against censorship.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For Milton, people cannot be truly educated, cannot truly know what is good, if they are only exposed to a limited set of ideas chosen by a limited set of gatekeepers. And although Milton&rsquo;s argument was not accepted by the short-lived English Commonwealth, his notions of the free distribution of ideas undergird modern ideas about freedom of the press.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Every society, and thus every system of higher education, will have its orthodoxies and the desire to protect those orthodoxies. And the risk of the free circulation of ideas is that people may be seduced by the evil ideas, or the ones outside the accepted orthodoxy — some of which may be not so much evil as simply different.</p>

<p>In my experience, the university — Christian or secular — functions at its best when it strives to understand its orthodoxies while also giving students the freedom to explore contrary ideas. Having commitments to certain values is a good thing, but that does not mean that we should censor anything outside those values. This balance, however, can be difficult to find; it is thus not at all surprising that in a time of social change some find comfort in clinging to old orthodoxies while refusing to acknowledge contrary ideas.</p>

<p>The irony is hard to miss when a school named &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; errs on the side of rejecting those outside of its orthodoxy, rather than permitting the free exchange of ideas. But it&rsquo;s worth taking this moment to consider the responsibility of Christian higher education: when an educational institution stops allowing dissenting voices, is it still educating? And is the goal of a Christian university to educate or to defend?</p>

<p>I think that the value of education far outweighs the risk of dangerous ideas. But we have to be willing to take the risk in order to gain the reward, and this is the dilemma that faces the university.</p>

<p>The past year has been a challenging one for me. Eleven months ago, after much agonizing, I decided to leave my job teaching English at a small Christian college in Tennessee. And more, I decided not to keep looking for another academic job if I didn&rsquo;t get one during the 2016-17 job season. Five years on the academic job market had made my soul weary, and I even though I love my field I couldn&rsquo;t continue to put myself through that process.</p>

<p>So I quit my job, and when another job offer never materialized I moved with my family back to the Chicago area. It&rsquo;s been a disorienting season in many ways, although I&rsquo;m writing — this blog among other things — and slowly stretching into new ideas about my future.</p>

<p>But this is Thanksgiving, and in the midst of all the transitions of the last year I have much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;m thankful to those of you reading this blog. Thanks for your support, and keep sharing posts you like with others who may appreciate them!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my former students, who challenged me to be a careful reader and clear communicator, and who indulged my nerdy enthusiasm for books and words.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to my former colleagues for their warm and generous support, for wise advice, letters of recommendation, and sour cream donuts from Dunkin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for our friends in Tennessee, who loved us even as we left them and supported us in our move.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for old friends who welcomed us back to the Chicago area, and fed us and watched our kids while we unloaded and unpacked boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who have so generously welcomed us into our new church, making us feel at home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for my husband, who worked tirelessly to set up this website and who has been encouraging and supportive during this transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my daughters, who remind me to laugh and play and drink hot cocoa on chilly afternoons.</p>

<p>I hope that all of you have good food and good company and many things to be thankful for this year. And for those of you who have struggled this year or who find Thanksgiving difficult, may you have a day of peace.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p></div>
