<p>This could be a very short blog post: my answer to the question of whether I am still an evangelical is that I&rsquo;m really not sure. Probably not. But maybe.</p>

<p>I started drifting from evangelicalism so gradually that I hardly noticed at first. I grew up evangelical and I attended college at the evangelical Harvard (aka Wheaton College), but at Wheaton I began to understand that &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; are not synonyms.</p>

<p>I became Anglican, and while some Anglicans consider themselves evangelical, others don&rsquo;t — to be Anglican need not mean being evangelical.</p>

<p>And I started graduate school at a highly-ranked state university. I had already begun to sour on the culture war mentality that permeates much of evangelicalism, and as I lived and developed relationships outside the evangelical bubble I became completely disenchanted with the &ldquo;us against the world&rdquo; mentality of the evangelical culture wars.</p>

<p>To me, evangelicalism had become too tightly linked to conservative politics and to doctrines I no longer held, like complementarianism and creationism. Plus, I never felt particularly connected to evangelicalism, probably due to my uneasiness from a young age about conversionism. And so I simply let &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; slip from my Christian identity — I had no reason to renounce it, but no reason to embrace it either.</p>

<p>And then 2016 happened.</p>

<p>I was angry at evangelicals. What happened to the values I had been taught growing up? How could the same people who (rightly) deplored Bill Clinton&rsquo;s behavior turn around and justify similar, and worse, behavior by Trump? How could compassionate conservatism turn into dehumanizing rhetoric against people of color?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> How could evangelicals sell their souls for political gain?</p>

<p>But I was also, for the first time, a tiny bit hopeful for evangelicalism. A handful of prominent evangelicals vocally criticized Trump. They pointed out the hypocrisy of supporting Trump. They urged their fellow evangelicals not to support someone who bragged about assaulting women, who displayed breathtaking arrogance even about matters of faith, who lied continually.</p>

<p>Their words were clearly too little, too late; the soul of evangelicalism had become corrupted long before the 2016 election. But for the first time, I saw evangelical leaders waking up to the problems inherent in linking doctrine and political power.</p>

<p>I had no desire to identify as evangelical, though. I felt as if I was watching an old friend I had fallen out of touch with begin to grow a conscience — a good development, but no longer one that affected me.</p>

<p>And then, in April, I attended a panel at the Festival of Faith and Writing with essayists from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830845372/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=intoresurrect-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0830845372&amp;linkId=942f105619cef033b5048ad7404a2d6d">Still Evanglical.</a> The four women on the panel — Kathy Khang, Karen Swallow Prior, Deidra Riggs, and Sandra Maria Van Opstal — were heartbreakingly honest about the challenges of remaining evangelical. Three of these women are women of color, whose challenges as members of evangelical churches are even greater. All of them see themselves as prophetic voices calling evangelicals back to Jesus, back to love, away from the seductive call of political power and nationalism.</p>

<p>Part of me — if I&rsquo;m honest, a large part — wants to wash my hands of evangelicalism. Evangelicals have made their bed, so to speak; let them reap the consequences of their actions. Let them fade into political irrelevance, let them be excoriated by the press, let them suffer for the hypocrisy that allows them to proclaim that families matter and then justify family separation as a deterrent for immigration, that allows them to fight against abortion and turn around to shame women in their churches who are unmarried and pregnant, that allows them to be incredibly sensitive about the smallest slight against themselves while ignoring the oppression of so many in America.</p>

<p>But those feelings are not particularly charitable. Much as I would like to dismiss evangelicals as power-hungry hypocrites, I know too many who are not. I do believe evangelicalism as a whole have lost its way, emphasizing moralism at the expense of love and never examining the painful racism and sexism embedded in the church.</p>

<p>But if they have lost their way, they can find it again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s my job to help evangelicals find their way. I&rsquo;ve been on the edges for so long that I&rsquo;m comfortable here, learning alongside others who love Jesus and respect the bible but who find that evangelicalism doesn&rsquo;t help us do either well. I&rsquo;m probably not still evangelical.</p>

<p>But I honor and admire the work of those who call evangelicals to repentance, to those who speak prophetically even when their audience responds with hostility. I pray for the healing of the evangelical church so that it can once again be light and salt, known for being Jesus in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I finished this piece on Wednesday, June 20 — just before Trump signed an executive order halting family separations. I hope this order is a reaction to many voices raised in outrage, but I have little trust in this administration. I believe that immigrants and asylum-seekers will continue to be oppressed in other, often more subtle ways. Also, as of today, there is no plan for reuniting separated children and families. We must remain committed to seeing the least of these as Christ sees them, not as our government sees them.</em></p>

<p>I always think that the scariest passage in scripture is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:34-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 28:34-46.</a> It&rsquo;s worth quoting in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote><p>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</p>

<p>“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</p>

<p>“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p>

<p>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’</p>

<p>“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’</p>

<p>“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</p>

<p>“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Protestants have long held that faith alone brings salvation; we do not need to work to earn our salvation. What the reformers meant by <em>sola fide</em> is that only the work of Christ can accomplish salvation; no human effort can reconcile us to God. But despite this basic reality acknowledged by all orthodox Christians, over and over again scripture reminds us that our actions matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:20&amp;version=NIV">James</a> tells us that faith without works is useless. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:12&amp;version=NIV">Paul</a> tells us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Throughout scripture, faith and obedience, faith and action, go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>So we should not be surprised when Jesus declares that those who ignored the least of these — the poor, the outcast, the marginalized, the ill, the uneducated, the unloved and unlovely, the oppressed — have ignored him.</p>

<p>If our faith does not lead us to compassionate action, what good is that faith? That faith becomes a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">clanging cymbal</a>, a faith devoid of love and empathy, a faith that annoys and provokes without contributing anything valuable to those who hear it.</p>

<p>If our love for Jesus doesn&rsquo;t move us to care for the least of these, do we really know Jesus at all?</p>

<hr />

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a hypothetical discussion, of course. The situation on the border as children are pulled away from their parents demands that we respond. We cannot afford to be numb or callous, even when the government or pundits ask us to shrug our shoulders at the suffering inflicted on whole families.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and someone uses the bible to defend that suffering.</p>

<p>Jesus is crammed into a building with hundreds of others, and someone says it is basically summer camp.</p>

<p>Jesus is separated from his family, but someone says he&rsquo;ll be fine in foster care or whatever.</p>

<p>Jesus is pulled from his mother&rsquo;s breast, but someone says it is necessary for national security.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and our government wants us to ignore that suffering. They want us to see his suffering as not real suffering, or as deserved suffering, or as someone else&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>But as Christians, our ultimate loyalty isn&rsquo;t to our government. It&rsquo;s to the kingdom of God. Paul may tell us to obey the governing authorities, but he does not tell us to trust in them. We must see people as Jesus sees them, not as the ruling powers and authorities see them.</p>

<p>We must see Jesus <em>in</em> people, particularly in the people those in power want us to fear. For what do we gain by dehumanizing others in order to gain favor from those in power? What good comes from selling our souls to power, to nationalism, to a pragmatic <em>quid pro quo</em>?</p>

<p>Will we sell our souls for the illusion of safety, for the supposed good of our nation? Will we accept the trauma of another as the cost of our own comfort? Will we place nationalist values above the values of the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p>Or will we refuse to be complicit with the powers of this world? Will we refuse to  remain silent as those in power inflict cruel suffering on the least of these, on people who bear the image of God, on people with whom Jesus identifies?</p>

<p>We must take a stand. We must pray, and donate, and make phone calls; we must march and write and vote and refuse to accept the dehumanization and oppression of these beloved children of God.</p>

<p>This is a moment when we can remind the world that faith is not a clanging cymbal but a motivation to defend the defenseless, to help the helpless, to show love to others no matter what they look like or where they came from.</p>

<p>And more than showing the world, we serve Jesus as we work for the good of the least of these. Let us not be found empty-handed and cold-hearted when we see Jesus before us, hungry, thirsty and imprisoned.</p></div>

<p>Father&rsquo;s Day rarely carries the emotional weight of Mother&rsquo;s Day. The whole tone of the holiday is different, lighter: fathers get ties and grilling utensils, not hand-drawn cards and crafts make with handprints. Father&rsquo;s Day cards are likely to be jokey, or at least less sentimental than Mother&rsquo;s Day cards. Breakfast in bed, with the family curled up together, is for mothers; backyard grilling is for fathers.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have seen a upwelling of sensitivity around the emotional landmines of Mother&rsquo;s Day. People write articles and Facebook posts reminding others to be sensitive to those who want to be mothers but aren&rsquo;t, who have difficult relationships with their own mothers or children, who have lost mothers or children.</p>

<p>I saw one such Facebook post about fathers this weekend.</p>

<p>This situation shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. Modern American culture still doesn&rsquo;t have much room for men&rsquo;s emotions, particularly the emotions around tenderness and nurturing that we associate with mothers. It seems to me that there has been some cultural improvement in this direction, but our <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">societal notions of masculinity</a> still have little room for men&rsquo;s emotions beyond anger.</p>

<p>To be clear, I know many men with tender hearts, men who are nurturing fathers who freely show their emotional selves to their children and to others. But cultural ideas about masculinity make it difficult for many men, for many fathers, to express their full emotional selves.</p>

<p>These notions about manhood damage men, pushing them to repress and deny the full range of human emotions. But these ideas about masculinity can also interfere with our conception of God, especially God the Father.</p>

<p>When we think of God the Father through the lens of our cultural definition of manhood, and even fatherhood, it becomes easy to imagine God as distant, unavailable, even angry and easily provoked. But when we do this, we risk missing the tender and nurturing care integral to God&rsquo;s fatherhood.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite image of God as nurturing father comes from the book of Hosea. God says to Hosea, “It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them” (Hos. 11:3-4, NIV).</p>

<p>These images of God helping a toddler walk and feeding a young child remind us that God’s fatherly love is full of tenderness and patience. God nurtures by feeding a toddler, helping that toddler walk — doing for the child what they cannot do for themselves. And I love that image of God lifting a child to his cheek: this shows a moment of care and connection, a moment when that child feels safe, secure, and the center of a father&rsquo;s undivided attention.</p>

<p>This image of God as father shows a father who is present, patient, encouraging, tender — not distant. In the context of Hosea, God is angry and disappointed at how far his children have strayed. But even in that anger God reminds his people that he has loved them and still loves them, that he still wants to nurture them if they will allow themselves to be nurtured.</p>

<p>God frequently uses parenthood as a metaphor for God&rsquo;s love and care for us, and so our own conceptions of fatherhood and motherhood matter for our ideas about God. Let us remember that God shows us tenderness and nurturing care, and let us free men from cultural ideas of masculinity so that they can fully embrace and show their ability to be tender nurturers.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this idea of fatherhood as distant is responsible for the incredibly problematic idea of God punishing his son instead of us. This idea fits with cultural conceptions of masculinity and fatherhood, but misses the reality of the Trinity: God isn&rsquo;t punishing Jesus; rather, God is taking on God&rsquo;s own pain and disappointment in order to restore the relationship between God and humanity.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

</figure></p>

<p>Back at the end of March, I launched a new recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture.</a> In this series, I want to highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority. The incarnation and then then death of Jesus exemplify this subversion best: the creator of the universe became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire. But through his life and death, Jesus conquered a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire and, in so doing, upended our comfortable notions about how power works.</p>

<p>And yet, in America in 2018 we Christians are often far too ready to place our trust in power, our hope in influence, our confidence in our political stances and leaders. It&rsquo;s easy to point fingers at the 81% of evangelicals who supported Trump, and I certainly think that this part of the evangelical church needs to reexamine its relationship to nationalism and politics.</p>

<p>But those of use who aren&rsquo;t evangelical, or aren&rsquo;t sure if we&rsquo;re still evangelical, or who are evangelical but not Christian nationalists, still need the reminder that the first shall be last, that a little child shall lead them, that the foolishness of Christ humbles the wise.</p>

<p>I need the reminder that God is at work in and through the seemingly weak and marginalized, that I will find Jesus where I least expect, that God does not need our achievements or our perfection.</p>

<p>And I also need the reminder that God is a God of justice who will right the wrongs done by the powerful to the weak.</p>

<p>We find this God who does justice and humbles the powerful in the story of Tamar and Judah. This story, told in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+38&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 38,</a> is one of the many odd Old Testament stories, narratives that leave us slightly puzzled about why they were included. In the narrative, Tamar marries one of Judah&rsquo;s son — Judah, who is the eldest son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Judah&rsquo;s son, Tamar&rsquo;s first husband, dies; Tamar then becomes the wife of Judah&rsquo;s second son, Onan. This second son, however, refuses to father a child with Tamar since that child would be considered his brother&rsquo;s rather than his.</p>

<p>God sees this refusal as wicked, so Onan also dies. At this point, Judah&rsquo;s third son is too young to take a wife, so Tamar lives in Judah&rsquo;s house as a widow in the expectation that she will be given a third husband.</p>

<p>A brief history break here: in the patriarchal culture of the Old Testament, women had few individual rights and thus needed men to care for them. A father, then a husband, then a son: without this progression of men in her life, a woman risked poverty and worse. Without a son, Tamar&rsquo;s future is bleak and even her present is tenuous, since she depends entirely on the good will of her father-in-law Judah.</p>

<p>And so, when Tamar sees that Judah&rsquo;s third son is old enough to marry and Judah has made no move to marry the two of them, an inaction that prevents Tamar from having a son, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. Disguised as a shrine prostitute, she sleeps with Judah himself and becomes pregnant, keeping Judah&rsquo;s seal as payment — although Judah does not know who she is.</p>

<p>When Judah hears that Tamar is pregnant, he furiously orders her execution. But confronted with the evidence that Tamar&rsquo;s child is his, Judah reverses his judgment and declares that Tamar &ldquo;is more righteous than I, since I wouldn&rsquo;t give her to my son Shelah&rdquo; (Gen. 38:26, NIV).</p>

<p>That &ldquo;more righteous than I&rdquo; should give us pause. Typically, disguising oneself as a prostitute in order to get pregnant by ones' father-in-law is frowned upon, both now and centuries ago. And yet Judah not only acknowledges her cleverness in securing a child for herself, he declares that her decision to take this action is <em>righteous.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s righteous because, despite her low status as a childless widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s household, Tamar takes steps to address the injustice Judah has committed by denying her a husband and thus a son. Judah recognizes that Tamar has corrected his wrong, and he praises her for doing so.</p>

<p>Moreover, God blesses Tamar&rsquo;s subversive action. She gives birth to not only one son, but two. And in another scriptural oddity, as Tamar gives birth one twin sticks his hand out first and is designated the firstborn — but then he withdraws his hand and his brother is actually born first. I don&rsquo;t envy Tamar&rsquo;s labor, but she ends up with essentially <em>two</em> first-born sons: a doubled blessing from God and doubled promise of a secure future.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Tamar&rsquo;s story is fascinating for its glimpse into ancient customs and the status of women — a status that led Tamar to take a dangerous risk as she sought justice for herself. She&rsquo;s a woman from scripture whose bravery and determination are worth hearing more about.</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>In Matthew&rsquo;s gospel, Matthew names four women in his genealogy of Jesus. The first of these women? Tamar (Matt. 1:3).</p>

<p>Yes, Tamar makes it into the genealogy of Jesus by tricking her father-in-law into sleeping with her. Which is not to say that she is somehow more sinful than the men in the genealogy: the line from Abraham to Jesus is full of men whose actions are far from ideal. But with only four women listed to the forty men — and listed alongside, not in place of, the fathers and sons — we must ask why Tamar makes Matthew&rsquo;s list.</p>

<p>From the Genesis account, what we learn about Tamar is that she holds a powerful man accountable for the injustice that he has done to her. Her methods may be unorthodox, but Judah himself cannot fault them: she was driven to such drastic action by his own failure and inaction, as he himself recognizes.</p>

<p>Judah recognizes Tamar&rsquo;s righteousness; God blesses her with two sons; the writers and editors of Genesis include her story as an integral episode in the lives of Israel&rsquo;s patriarchs; and finally, Matthew lists her in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>Tamar is a woman who rights the wrong done to her, who stands up for justice when no one else will. In so doing she humbles the powerful Judah — and earns his respect. She is one of the least of these, living on the margins of her household as a widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s house. But scripture shows us through the birth of her sons and through her inclusion in both Genesis and Matthew that God was on her side, on the side of the weak and the powerless.</p>

<p>Let Tamar be an example to us: an example of the extremes people may be driven to in order to right an injustice, and an example of how God honors the seemingly insignificant by raising them to a place of honor.</p>

<p>Tamar&rsquo;s twins are also another story of the expected order subverted: like Jacob, who takes his elder brother Esau&rsquo;s birthright, or Jacob blessing Joseph&rsquo;s son Ephraim as the firstborn even though Manasseh is older. Tamar&rsquo;s son Perez is not the one who put out his hand first but the one who was born first, and he is the son who is in the lineage of Jesus.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>Before I post about what I&rsquo;m enjoying this month, I want to say that the suffering of immigrant families is breaking my heart. It seems that outrage over separated families is growing, and it should; but the outrage also needs to become action so that innocent children, many whose parents fled horrific situations to seek asylum in the U.S., are no longer separated from their parents without concrete plans for reunification.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus made it clear that he valued children and he had harsh words for those who harm them. Christians cannot place their nationalism above the suffering of children, and so I ask you to consider taking action. Prayer is obviously important, but I have found these two resources helpful: Glennon Melton&rsquo;s organization <a href="https://momastery.com/blog/2018/05/30/lawmakers/">Together Rising</a> has raised money for legal representation for these children; she also gives concrete action steps. Jennifer Hofmann&rsquo;s <a href="https://jenniferhofmann.com/home/weekly-action-checklist-democrats-independents-republicans-conscience/">Americans of Conscience Checklist</a> covers much more than immigration, but she provides information about how to contact elected officials to voice concerns about a variety of issues, including immigration and specifically the separation of children from their parents at the border.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s easy for me at least to feel overwhelmed and discouraged, wondering what my single voice can possibly accomplish. But if I can join my voice with others, add my dollars to others, combine my prayers with others, we can accomplish much. Please join me in taking a step today towards love and justice for these children and their families.</em></p>

<p><em>And now, the things that are making me happy this month.</em></p>

<p>June has arrived, with green everywhere and flowers blooming and kids spending their days outside. I love this season of long days and still-cool evenings; even the rain drips cheerfully.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m especially loving our new house. The backyard has lush green grass perfect for running barefoot, plus a swing for hours of entertainment — and even a porch swing for the grownups. I have a climbing rose blooming pink by my front door, a clematis growing over a trellis, and a line of tomatoes in pots. So many lovely plants have put down their roots in the rich dark soil — I feel invited to do likewise.</p>

<p>Thinking of growing things, I&rsquo;m also incredibly excited about being a first-time CSA subscriber. I&rsquo;ve thought about doing CSAs for several years now but I&rsquo;ve never actually taken the plunge. I picked up my first box of spring produce on Saturday — kale, green onions, micro greens, salad greens, swiss chard — and I&rsquo;m so excited to see what else comes in the box over the rest of the summer.</p>

<p>But summer isn&rsquo;t only a time for fresh veggies and smores by the fire pit. It&rsquo;s also time to catch up on reading. What am I reading, you ask? Always far too much!</p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Il2UK5"><em>The Spirit of Life</em>,</a> Jürgen Moltmann: still working my way through this one. I plan to actually finish it this month, but it has <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/05/pentecost">already reshaped</a> how I think about the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tu4kMM"><em>The Story of a Happy Marriage</em></a>, Ann Patchett: my little brother&rsquo;s awesome girlfriend (hi, Julia!) recommended Ann Patchett, and further recommended that I start with this book of essays. This was an excellent recommendation. I love Patchett&rsquo;s voice in these essays, and I&rsquo;m excited to read her novels now.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fiction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MSFjnw"><em>Three Parts Dead</em></a>, Max Gladstone: I&rsquo;m cheating a little, since I finished this at the end of May, but it&rsquo;s the first epic fantasy novel I&rsquo;ve enjoyed in a long time. It&rsquo;s a book about a necromancer and a dead god and the complications that arise when gods are real but may or may not be not worthy of religious devotion, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2yALPvT"><em>The Inquisitor&rsquo;s Tale</em></a>, Adam Gidwitz: an award-winning children&rsquo;s book set in medieval France. My eldest child enjoyed it, and so am I so far; here&rsquo;s hoping that it stays good and doesn&rsquo;t push me into cranky academic medievalist territory!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tpfwee"><em>Vicious</em></a>, V.E. Schwab: this one is at the top of my TBR pile. I flew threw her <em>Shades of Magic</em> series last winter, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I have also discovered fiction podcasts. I listened to one put out by Tor publishers last summer — <a href="https://tor-labs.com/steal-the-stars/"><em>Steal the Stars</em></a> — and loved finding radio drama for the digital age. So I when needed something to distract me while I painted and unpacked in the new house, I googled fiction podcasts and hit pay dirt.</p>

<p>My search turned up the show <a href="https://arsparadoxica.com"><em>Ars Paradoxica</em>,</a> and this was a wonderful (and hopefully not too creepily personalized) recommendation. <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is about a woman who accidentally invents time travel, and the spiraling effects of her invention. I love it so much. The show just ended after three seasons and the final episode is sitting in my podcast app; I want to know how it ends, but I&rsquo;m going to miss these characters so much when it&rsquo;s finally over and I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to listen yet.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the creative talent behind <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is also behind two other shows that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, <a href="https://www.whisperforge.org"><em>The Far Meridian</em> and <em>Star Tripper</em></a> (the latter is a brand-new comedy). And due to a cross-over episode, I discovered <a href="http://www.thebrightsessions.com"><em>The Bright Sessions</em>,</a> about a therapist for people with extraordinary abilities who herself has an agenda. (And other cross-over episodes and vocal talents have given me a few more to put on my to-listen list!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly a little surprised by how much I love these podcasts, especially since I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of audiobooks. I don&rsquo;t object to audiobooks — they totally count as &ldquo;real&rdquo; reading! — but I tend to space out and lose the narrative thread. But the dramatic aspects of the podcast seem to catch my imagination and hold my attention much better, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to have found them.</p>

<p>In between the moving and the gardening and the books and the podcasts, I haven&rsquo;t had time for movies. Not even <em>Avengers</em>, which is making me sad. But my husband and I are continuing our re-watch of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and I am happy to report that it continues to hold up both to a rewatch and to time, since it has been over 20 years since the first season aired.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also enjoying <em>Life in Pieces</em>, a short comedy that follows the various members of mostly functional extended family. It&rsquo;s light and funny and heartwarming without being sappy, which makes it perfect for evening relaxation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m loving the extra space that summer brings — space to read, to ride bikes, to sit on the deck with friends. I hope that this June brings growth and space for all of you as well, dear readers.</p></div>
