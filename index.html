<p><em>I started writing this post a week ago, to go up on the 12th — then I spent the weekend at the Festival of Faith and Writing and didn&rsquo;t actually post anything. I assumed I&rsquo;d have to rework the beginning because it&rsquo;s April and it should be spring … but I woke up to snow on the ground yesterday so Henryson&rsquo;s April is still much closer to my reality than Chaucer&rsquo;s!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the opening to Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>Canterbury Tales,</em> with the sweet showers of April bringing life and energy to places and people parched by the drought of winter. Actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how my April has made me want to huddle indoors, by a fire, rather than venturing out on any sort of pilgrimage (even just to the grocery store). I feel much more like the narrator of Robert Henryson&rsquo;s <em>Testament of Cresseid,</em> who ventures outside on an April night in Scotland to watch Venus rise, but is defeated by the whistling north wind and returns indoors to thaw by his fire.</p>

<p>I try to bolster myself during this long, cold spring with thoughts of superiority; after all, <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/byron/don-juan/1/">as Byron asserts,</a> &ldquo;Happy the nations of the moral north!&rdquo; But then I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the assertion that northern people (that is, Europeans) are morally superior to other people groups, even if Byron with his notorious lack of morality certainly meant this line as a sly joke. So I turn to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44428/the-negro-speaks-of-rivers">Langston Hughes</a> for an antidote, with his soul grown deep like a wide, warm river.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the power of poetry last week, when I spent twenty minutes reading poems to a group of first grade students (including one of my daughters). <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope is the thing with feathers&rdquo;</a> lost them, sadly, although Dickinson is never my favorite so I secretly sympathize. But they loved <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58421/on-paper">&ldquo;on paper&rdquo; by Jacqueline Woodson</a> and they giggled through William Carlos Williams' <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say">&ldquo;This is Just to Say.&rdquo;</a> Perhaps best of all, they were amazed that Billy Collins would write a poem about <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55737/cheerios">Cheerios,</a> which is humorous enough to capture a first-grader but hooks us adults with its meditation on age and aging and time.</p>

<p>When I taught English classes, I read poetry regularly. I read poems from Homer and Sappho; Dante, Chaucer, and Marie de France; Donne, Herbert, Mary Sidney, and Milton. I even, occasionally, ventured into more modern poetry. But since leaving my teaching job nearly a year ago, I&rsquo;ve read much less poetry. I have at least one prose novel going all the time (often more), but as I was searching for poems to bring to my daughter&rsquo;s class I realized how much I miss reading poetry.</p>

<p>Poetry has an evocative and emotional power that often evades prose, even the most lyrical and powerful prose. All writers must wrestle with words, striving to convey ideas and emotions to their readers. But the poet must be sensitive to the meaning of the words and their sounds, the ideas and the rhythms conveyed by each word. But the very best poems do this in a way that bypasses our head and goes straight to our heart.</p>

<p>Even the most intellectual of poets, like John Donne or T.S. Eliot, offer a depth beyond intellectual puzzles and learned allusions. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud">Donne&rsquo;s Holy Sonnet 10</a> contains a brief argument against the power of death, but the poem&rsquo;s punch comes not in its logic but its resounding final lines: &ldquo;One short sleep past, we wake eternally / And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.&rdquo; The weight and finality of the heavy syllables in the last line underscore emotionally the truth that death will indeed die.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why the Bible contains so much poetry. The Psalms, of course, but also various songs and hymns are preserved throughout scripture. Rhythm and music help people remember, especially crucial in largely illiterate cultures; but this memory goes beyond intellect to embed itself in the soul as poetry links mind and emotion.</p>

<p>I have, at times, wished that the bible were more like a guidebook, or perhaps a systematic theology. But we are more than our minds; we are our bodies and our emotions and our communities. God wants to reach us in every aspect of our being, and so in addition to Paul we have the parable of Jesus; in addition to the chronicles of the kings we have psalms; and the whole of scripture is framed by poems about creation and new creation.</p>

<p>So this month, in celebration of poetry, curl up by the fire (or if you&rsquo;re lucky, find a pleasant park bench) and read a poem. Read a psalm, or Mary&rsquo;s magnificat, or Miriam&rsquo;s song; read John Donne or George Herbert or Mary Sidney or, for a giggle, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43639/the-disappointment">Aphra Behn&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Disappointment.&rdquo;</a> Find a new poet or revisit an old friend, and engage your mind and your heart.</p></div>

<p>Most parents experience at least a twinge of emotion as they send their child off to kindergarten: that first day of school marks a significant transition. I certainly felt that twinge when I dropped my oldest off for the first time. But for me, the twinge was heightened by the fact that I wasn’t just sending my daughter into a new experience for her; I was entering a new experience myself.</p>

<p>You see, I was homeschooled. About six weeks into first grade at a public school, my parents pulled me out. They meant it as a short-term solution, but my younger siblings and I ended up homeschooled through our high school graduations. And we became, gradually, the sort of homeschooling family that views public schools as evil, hotbeds of liberal politics and myriad vices.</p>

<p>So how did I end up sending my own children to public schools? …</p>

<p><em><a href="http://erinwasinger.com/2018/04/09/children-gain-a-community-of-support-at-local-school/">Read the rest</a> over at Erin Wasinger&rsquo;s blog, where this piece is part of her &ldquo;Passing Notes&rdquo; series on choosing public schools.</em></p></div>

<p>I have a few things I want to say to April in the Chicagoland area: seriously? Wintry mix that is actually huge fluffy snowflakes all afternoon? Highs in the 30s? Where is my spring? I DEMAND SPRING. I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the south and I want to wear my Tevas, not my parka.</p>

<p>Ahem. Some thoughts and updates to start off the month:</p>

<p><strong>Moving!</strong></p>

<p>We bought a new house (yay!) and after assembling countless Ikea bookshelves I am ready to start unpacking my books. The vast majority of them have been boxed up for the last year, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get them out. We won&rsquo;t move all the way in for a few weeks yet, which gives us some time to paint and do cosmetic work on the house and, most importantly, set up the bookshelves.</p>

<p>(Also, I&rsquo;m pleased to report that my marriage survived both a trip to Ikea and assembling Ikea furniture. Life achievement unlocked.)</p>

<p><strong>Whole30:</strong></p>

<p>March was also my Whole30 month. It ended up being more like a Whole24, and I added legumes back in about halfway through. I decided when I began that I wasn&rsquo;t going to stress about &ldquo;compliance,&rdquo; making sure that no forbidden food passed my lips. So I definitely ate some dairy (blue cheese crumbles on my Chick-fil-A salad) and sugar (in my Panera salad dressing), but for the most part I avoided dairy, sugar and grains.</p>

<p>The Whole30 program hits my perfectionist buttons with its philosophy that you have to do it <em>perfectly</em> or start the whole program over, but I gave myself permission from the beginning to not be perfect. I tend to strive for perfection then give up in frustration when I&rsquo;m not perfect, so I knew that if I wanted to actually reset my eating habits I needed to give myself some room to fail.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m pleased to say that Whole30 (err, Whole24) was overall a good experience. I don&rsquo;t intend to keep up with the restrictions, or move towards a paleo diet, but it was good to remind myself that I can survive without sugary carbs. I found a fantastic new pork roast recipe, I reincorporated more veggies in my diet, and I discovered that cashew butter is <em>really good.</em> So I&rsquo;m counting it as a success (and very much enjoying my hot cross buns and chocolate Easter cake this week).</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong></p>

<p>I finished <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen</em> (Drew G.I. Hart), and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in racism in the church. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy read, but it is an important one. I also finished <em>Opting Out: Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home</em> (Pamela Stone). Stone examines the reasons why high-achieving women quit prestigious careers when they have children, and while her research certainly lined up with my own experience it made me angry all over again that even supposedly family-friendly workplaces do so little to support women (or men) to balance the demands of family and job, which pushes families into traditional gender roles even when that&rsquo;s not really what they want.</p>

<p>In fiction, I just finished Marie Lu&rsquo;s <em>Warcross.</em> One of the blurbs compared it to <em>Neuromancer,</em> and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite right; Lu crafts a compelling story, but her writing isn&rsquo;t quite on the level of Gibson. But I do think it&rsquo;s fair to compare it, and compare it favorably, to Ernest Cline&rsquo;s <em>Ready Player One.</em> Both feature a young protagonist unexpectedly caught up in a computer game with far-reaching global consequences, but I found Lu&rsquo;s world and characters more vivid than Cline&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also slowly making my way through <em>Gilead,</em> by Marilynne Robinson; I&rsquo;ve been putting of her novels for inscrutable reasons, but I am enjoying slowly taking in her gorgeous prose. And I&rsquo;m still working on Jürgen Moltmann&rsquo;s <em>The Spirit of Life</em>, and it is still rocking my world. I&rsquo;ve never had a good understanding of the Holy Spirit, and Moltmann is giving me so many new ways to think about this third person of the Trinity.</p>

<p><strong>Coming up:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning a post on Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz for my women in Christianity series, and one on Tamar for stories of subversion in scripture. Also, this is April, both national poetry month and the month when medievalists celebrate ancient languages — so expect something on medieval poetry.</p>

<p>On Monday next week, I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://erinwasinger.com/blog-2/">Erin Wasinger&rsquo;s blog</a> with a piece for her &ldquo;Passing Notes&rdquo; series on choosing public schools — come for my piece and stay for the rest of series, which is great! And if you missed it, I wrote about six influential medieval women for the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/6-medieval-women-who-shaped-christian-theology">CBE blog Arise.</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Maundy Thursday.</strong></p>

<p>An older couple, shuffling steps, bent backs, leaning heavily on canes. Helped by others as they kneel to wash each others feet. Love so beautiful it takes my breath away.</p>

<p><strong>Good Friday.</strong></p>

<p>Bricks clang and thud as they land at the foot of the cross, the weight of sin and shame made tangible. The wood of the cross rough beneath my palm as I kneel to pray. Can I give my bricks over to Jesus? Do I dare place them on the Son of God? But can I carry them myself?</p>

<p>It is finished.</p>

<p>Weightlessness.</p>

<p><strong>Easter Vigil.</strong></p>

<p>Cross veiled, altar bare. We hear the long story of salvation: Creation. Abraham and Isaac. The Israelites saved through the Red Sea. Dry bones taking on flesh, breathing again. My daughter dancing in the dark.</p>

<p>And then: lights, bells, deafening alleluias, flowers everywhere, the veil removed. Mary Magdalene meeting the risen Christ. My daughters twirling down the aisle, flowers in their hair, ribbons in their hands. I join them.</p>

<p>It is dark outside. But He is Risen.</p>

<p><strong>Easter.</strong></p>

<p>Banners, flowers, bells, gold and white. Loud alleluias. Joy. Jesus calls Mary by name.</p>

<p>He knows my name.</p>

<p>He is risen indeed.</p></div>

<p>Alongside my recurring series on women in Christianity, today I&rsquo;m launching a second recurring series on subversion in scripture. I will certainly feature women in this series, although the focus will be broader, considering the many times when the stories in the bible take an unexpected turn that undermines our expectations about power and authority.</p>

<p>So why this topic? Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about the meshing of American evangelical Christianity and political power. I&rsquo;ve also, in my professional life, read and taught extensively about the meshing of religious and political power in medieval and early modern Europe — a meshing found in both the Catholic church and most Protestant sects.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In my experience, American Christians are quick to condemn, say, medieval Catholicism for intertwining religion and politics. But the notion of a separate church and state is very new in the arc of human history: only for the last three hundred years, or less, have some societies seen this separation as desirable. Denying this history seems to blind us to the reality that in America we seldom fully separate religious and civil authority.</p>

<p>And the 2016 election has brought the embrace of political power in the church into sharp relief. Donald Trump, with his series of wives and marital infidelities, his crude language, his racism, his sexism, his narcissism, does not even remotely seem like a candidate that Christians would support. And yet white protestant Christians did, in droves. And <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/26/despite-porn-stars-and-playboy-models-white-evangelicals-arent-rejecting-trump-this-is-why/">recent research</a> shows a strong connection between Christian nationalism and voting for Trump — that is, Christians voted for him because they thought he was, despite his personal failings, the candidate most likely to protect Christianity in America.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So how can American Christians claim faith in Jesus — who was executed by state power — and then put their practical trust in someone like Trump?</p>

<p>I think that we, as is typical for human beings throughout history, have forgotten that the weak things of the world will overcome the strong, that the wisdom of the wise is foolishness in the face of Christ. We place our trust in rulers and authorities, forgetting that Christ overcame all of them by humbling himself to not only become human but to live, suffer and die as a human.</p>

<p>White American Christians live the life of the wealthy, the privileged, the colonizing rather than the colonized. We forget that the comfort and power we enjoy would have been foreign to Jesus or Paul. Because we are used to power, we believe that it should save and protect us. But in our concern to protect ourselves, we seldom examine how that power oppresses others.</p>

<p>We the Romans and the Pharisees.</p>

<p>I want to be clear: I am not advocating for Christians to remove themselves from governments or other institutions or the public sphere more generally. Involvement in society at all levels is, in my view, a good thing for Christians.</p>

<p>However, we must stop placing our trust in the powers of this world, or more specifically, in controlling and sharing the powers of this world.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> We especially must stop supporting those powers to the detriment of marginalized groups. And as we do this, it&rsquo;s worth re-examining scripture with an eye towards the many ways in which God uses the weak and the marginal and the outsiders instead of the powerful, indeed to humble the powerful.</p>

<p>And Holy Week is a particularly appropriate time to launch this series. For this week, we remember the most profound subversion of all: God entered the world as a poor Jewish carpenter, living and dying under the oppressive rule of the Romans. God could have blazed into the world in glory, crushing Caesar and elevating Israel to rule the world. Instead, God entered at the bottom of society as a human being, and instead of conquering, Jesus died.</p>

<p>And yet on Easter, Christ arose in glory. He hadn&rsquo;t defeated the Roman Empire, but he had done something far more profound: he defeated sin and death and evil. He instituted new life, resurrection life, that is breaking through into the world in the promise of its coming fullness.</p>

<p>What seemed weak and foolish — a marginal Jewish teacher betrayed by a friend and brutally executed by the Romans — became the most profound victory the world has ever, or will ever, see. And this was accomplished <em>through</em> and <em>for</em> the powerless and oppressed, not at their expense.</p>

<p>So let us examine scripture to recapture the reality that God does not need earthly power, nor do we. Political power can certainly be used for good. But far too often, it elevates one group over others and props up systems of injustice and oppression. When we place our hope in those systems, we miss the point of the gospel and erect an idol for ourselves.</p>

<p>Some Anabaptist groups argued that the church and state should separate. But if the Protestants and Catholics could agree on one thing in early modern Europe, it was that the Anabaptists were crazy and should be persecuted out of existence.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
