<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about Harvey Weinstein. Not because I don&rsquo;t care, or don&rsquo;t believe the accusations, or have nothing to say, but because I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m not shocked. I&rsquo;m not surprised. I&rsquo;m horrified, of course, although that reaction is dulled by too many repetitions of the same story.</p>

<p>But with #MeToo trending on Twitter as I write today, I feel the need to say something. It&rsquo;s not going to be something profound. It&rsquo;s not going to be the something that suddenly changes things for women. But it&rsquo;s one more something on the mound of stories and arguments and pleas that, maybe, someday, will grow into change.</p>

<p>When I say me too, I know I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones: I&rsquo;ve never been sexually assaulted. Just harassed. Just made to feel uncomfortable, just grateful to the friends — men and women — who&rsquo;ve looked out for me over the years, walking me to my car at night, warning me about the too-friendly professor, watching my drink at the bar.</p>

<p>In other words, just a typical woman.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem: I don&rsquo;t know any woman who hasn&rsquo;t experienced harassment in some form. It&rsquo;s everywhere, but that also means it&rsquo;s nowhere. Invisible.</p>

<p>Something like the allegations about Harvey Weinstein break onto the scene, and everyone is horrified. For a while. But we all know the pattern, because it happens so often: we feel outrage, but it seldom translates into an examination of why this keeps happening.</p>

<p>We start to distance ourselves. We chalk assault up to Hollywood culture. We have a hard time reconciling a genial figure peddling pudding in dorky sweaters with a habitual user of date rape drugs. We dismiss crude language about assaulting women as locker-room talk.</p>

<p>We wonder why women don&rsquo;t speak up about their experiences sooner, or louder, or somehow better. We read <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kMJV4o">op-eds</a> that suggest this sort of harassment happens to pretty women, less conservative women, women with less protective parents. We make this a liberal problem (Weinstein) or a conservative one (Roger Ailes), a worldly problem (Hugh Hefner) or a religious one (Bill Gothard).</p>

<p>As women, we are told and we tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re too sensitive, we can&rsquo;t take a joke, we&rsquo;re imagining things, we should be flattered by the attention. If we&rsquo;re careful enough, if we smile and nod, if we wear the right things and say the right things we&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Besides, how often does that sort of thing <em>really</em> happen?</p>

<p>And before we know it, we&rsquo;re back to normal — and maybe a career has ended, but more often nothing much happens and nothing much changes.</p>

<p>If we want this cycle to change, we must confront the fact that, as a society, we value women less than men. We find their pain less important than men&rsquo;s reputations. We believe them less, we subject them to greater scrutiny, we hold them to impossibly high standards.</p>

<p>This happens in churches and faith-based organization and in Hollywood. In academia and service industries. On the coasts and in rural Iowa. In Silicon Valley, in hospitals, in the C-suite, in factories. Women are harassed and assaulted by strangers and trusted friends, by colleagues and intimate partners, by bosses and subordinates.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m tired of people being periodically horrified by high-profile instances of assault. I want people to be horrified that half the population has to deal with harassment on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I want outrage and official action over the professors who have inappropriate contact with their students, not just a whisper network among women.</p>

<p>I want the comedian who tells a rape joke to hear horrified gasps, not laughter.</p>

<p>I want the pastor who delivers sexist jokes from the pulpit to be corrected by his parishioners, not allowed to persist.</p>

<p>I want the manager who touches inappropriately to be reprimanded, not ignored.</p>

<p>I want the colleague who makes off-color remarks to be ostracized, not excused.</p>

<p>I want the phrase &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo; stricken from our vocabulary.</p>

<p>I want to stop feeling so damn thankful that I&rsquo;ve only been harassed, not assaulted.</p>

<p>But until we work up the will as a culture to value women as human beings whose worth is equal to men, none of what I want will happen.</p></div>

<p>(Spoilers throughout)</p>

<p>I watched <em>La La Land</em> for the first time last week. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sold: I was a little bored by the meet cute, the mutual dislike opener to the romantic relationship, the aspiring actress falling for the snobby, nostalgic lover of jazz. But the ending? That got to me.</p>

<p>I must confess that I&rsquo;m a sucker for the unresolved ending, the ending where plot threads dangle and the happily-ever-afters dissolve into uncertainty. And <em>La La Land</em> subverts the ending we expect of a romantic comedy in ways that underscore the tensions between individuals and relationships and highlight the loss that always comes with the choices we make.</p>

<p>In the final dream sequence of the film, we see Emma Stone&rsquo;s character (Mia) imagine a different path for her relationship with Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling). The power of this dream sequence is that we, the viewers, want it to be true: the conventional romantic narrative of the majority of the film sets us up to want Mia and Sebastian to get to happily ever after together. Sebastian living alone, Mia married to another man — these do no make for a Hollywood ending. The dream sequence feels right, feels like the ending we deserve.</p>

<p>And yet. The dream sequence is a fantasy: it waves away the conflict between Mia and Sebastian, and not just the initial romantic attraction disguised as repulsion. It erases Sebastian&rsquo;s time with the band, erases his failure to come to Mia&rsquo;s one-woman show, erases their separation when Mia goes to Paris to star in a movie … and erases Sebastian&rsquo;s successful opening of his dream jazz club.</p>

<p>This dream sequence underscores the vital tension in the film between the relationship and the individual dreams of Mia and Sebastian: they can&rsquo;t have it all. They can&rsquo;t have each other while also fulfilling their separate dreams.</p>

<p><em>La La Land</em> layers the expectation of romantic comedies — that the relationship prevails — with the other prevailing film expectation that the characters follow their individual dreams. Sebastian tells Mia not to turn down the film in Paris because of him, and she doesn&rsquo;t. She ends up with the successful acting career she wanted, as well as a husband and child with whom she seems very happy. And Sebastian doesn&rsquo;t find a romantic partner, but he remains close to his sister and her family as he launches his own jazz club.</p>

<p>They have followed their dreams, they are both happy — but the final sequence underscores the cost, highlights what could have been had they made different choices. The film doesn&rsquo;t suggest that they have made wrong choices; the final look between Mia and Sebastian contains acceptance, not unhappiness. But this look also acknowledges the inevitable loss of making a choice.</p>

<p>What is the cost of pursuing your own dreams, of valuing your individuality over relationships, or even a single relationship? Is the cost worth what you gain? <em>La La Land</em> doesn&rsquo;t answer these questions, refuses to answer these questions — at the end of the film, both the future that is and the future that could have been are good. But the film forces us to ask that question.</p>

<p>Unlike most romantic comedies, where the characters either do end up having it all or where any individual loss is minimized compared to the relationship, <em>La La Land</em> forces us to consider what we value and what we lose in our choices. The film presents no solution, no formula for making these calculations. But the power of the ending lies in its acknowledgement of loss, its realization of the cost of the always inevitable choice between individual and relationship.</p></div>

<p>After all the medieval history, today we take an autumn-appropriate breath with some Old English poetry. The poem partially quoted below, <em>The Ruin</em>, is an elegy, a lament for things lost. Old English poetry has a rich selection of elegies, and this is one of my favorites. It comes from a tenth-century manuscript known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Book">Exeter book</a>, the largest of only a few surviving collections of Old English literature.</p>

<p>The poem itself, in the tradition of an elegy, meditates on ruins and the inevitable decay of all earthly things. In a fittingly poetic twist, the manuscript itself is also damaged, leaving the poem about ruins in ruins.</p>

<p>In a season overrun with decorative gourds and pumpkin spice delicacies that distract us from the coming winter, it&rsquo;s worth reflecting for a moment on falls, on ends, on decay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wondrous is this wall&rsquo;s foundation – <em>wyrd</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has broken</p>

<p>and shattered this city; the work of giants crumbles.</p>

<p>The roofs are ruined, the towers toppled,</p>

<p>frost in the mortar has broken the gate,</p>

<p>torn and worn and shorn by the storm,</p>

<p>eaten through with age. The earth’s grasp</p>

<p>holds the builders, rotten, forgotten,</p>

<p>the hard grip of the ground, until a hundred</p>

<p>generations of men are gone.</p>

<p>This wall, rust-stained</p>

<p>and covered with moss, has endured one kingdom after another,</p>

<p>stood in the storm, steep and tall, then tumbled.</p>

<p>The foundation remains, felled by the weather,</p>

<p>it fell…..<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>grimly ground up ….</p>

<p>……cleverly created….</p>

<p>…… a crust of mud surrounded …</p>

<p>….. put together a swift</p>

<p>and subtle system of rings; one of great wisdom</p>

<p>wondrously bound the braces together with wires.</p></blockquote>

</figure></p>

<p>The poem continues with descriptions of the inhabitants of this ruin, proud warriors who succumbed to plague and war despite their joy and bravery while they lived:</p>

<blockquote><p>The slain fell on all sides, plague-days came,</p>

<p>and death destroyed all the brave swordsmen;</p>

<p>the seats of their idols became empty wasteland,</p>

<p>the city crumbled, its re-builders collapsed</p>

<p>beside their shrines. So now these courts are empty,</p>

<p>and the rich vaults of the vermilion roofs</p>

<p>shed their tiles.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Unlike other Old English elegies, <em>The Ruin</em> has no explicitly Christian themes, no reference to the eternal nature of God. It&rsquo;s a poem about a lost civilization (most scholars connect it to the Roman ruins in modern-day Bath), and as such a reminder that all civilizations come to an end. Reading it today, in the twenty-first century, we have an added layer of poignancy: the author and his culture have crumbled into the ruins of history, the poem itself existing in ruins — a memorial, as were the Roman ruins, to those who produced them.</p>

<p>This probably seems like an odd way to end a series that attempts to reclaim the middle ages from those who would distort them in the service of damaging ideologies. And I could have chosen any number of other cultural relics that are more up-beat, more exemplary of the rich and diverse culture of the middle ages.</p>

<p>But at the beginning of this series, I talked about the culture wars as a fight to define and defend western culture — and those actions require that we also preserve western culture. Against this urge for preservation, this poem reminds us that all things end, all things decay; winter always comes, no matter how bountiful the harvest.</p>

<p>And yet something also always remains. The inhabitants of the ruins, like the author of the poem and the copyists of the manuscript, have vanished — but the ruins, the poem, the things themselves, they survive. There is loss, yes, but memory remains. An elegy can only exist if something is remembered, is valued enough to remember.</p>

<p>Change can feel like death, like loss. And I think it&rsquo;s obvious that western culture, especially after centuries of colonization and globalization, is changing. But all things end; this is the way of the world. We may mourn the end, elegize the great monuments of the past. But someday we too will be mourned and elegized by those who come after us.</p>

<p>This knowledge can free us from the need to preserve, from the need to prevent change. And as the seasons shift, let us take a moment to contemplate the transience of the world.</p>

<p>So far in this series on white supremacy and the middle ages, we&rsquo;ve established that medieval Europe was not <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">&ldquo;dark&rdquo;</a> but rather a vital <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">building block</a> of western culture — which means that we cannot simply abandon the period to white supremacists. Additionally, on <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-and-race">Monday</a> I sketched out the problems with the idea that the middle ages were racially homogenous, problems that relate both to the historical facts and to our projection of post-Enlightenment race onto the medieval period. Today, I conclude with one of the thornier events of the middle ages: the crusades.</p>

<p>Alt-right movements both in America and in Europe tend to be anti-Islam, using images and phrases (like <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-38353706">deus vult</a>) from the medieval crusades to underscore a commitment to protecting western culture from outside threats. The only problem with this is the fact that the medieval crusades weren&rsquo;t about protecting Europe from outside threats.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to start with a brief timeline of the rise of Islam and the crusades. Muhammad, whose visions in the early 7th century became the Qu'ran, founded a religious community that quickly united the tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Neither the Byzantine Empire to the north and west or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> to the east had ever had much interest in controlling the arid Arabian peninsula, so Muhammad and his successors filled a power vacuum in the area and quickly began to expand. In the first 150 years of Islam, Arabic tribes conquered across North Africa, into Europe in the Iberian peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), to the east in the old Persian empire, and northward into the Byzantine empire.</p>

<p>As rapidly as the Arabic empire spread, it did not make it into western Europe beyond the Iberian peninsula and the island of Sicily. In the late eighth century, Umayyad incursions into modern-day France were decisively rebuffed by French rulers. After this point, Muslim rulers controlled most of the Iberian peninsula (which they named Al-Andalus) but no longer attempted to invade western Europe across the Pyrenees. And while the history of medieval Spain could be an entire post, it&rsquo;s worth noting that even as Christians reclaimed parts of Spain the Christian/Muslim divide was seldom clear or simplistic. Often Christian rulers warred against their Muslim neighbors, but just as often they allied with Muslim rulers to fight a common enemy — Christian or Muslim. In other words, the narrative of Muslim conquest and Christian resistance does not match the more complicated reality in medieval Spain.</p>

<p>The island of Sicily, off the toe of the boot of the Italian peninsula, was also controlled at least partially by Muslim rulers for about 250 years between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Because of its desirable position for trade across the Mediterranean, Sicily has been controlled by most of the key players in the region at one point or another; in the medieval period, it was held by the Goths, then the Byzantines, then Muslim rulers, then the Norman French before becoming a point of contention between the pope, the Holy Roman emperors, and Spanish rulers. In other words, Arabic rulers were one of a multitude of people groups who sought to control the island and its trade — and for Muslim rulers, Sicily was not a launching point for European invasion but a key shipping location in the busy commercial world of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In short, after the eighth century the Latin west — the old western part of the Roman empire — was not under serious threat of invasion and conquest by Arabic Muslims.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> However, the old eastern half of the Roman empire, now known as the Byzantine empire, saw a different situation. Because it bordered the Arabian peninsula and in the early middle ages controlled trade routes in what we call the Middle East, the Byzantine empire experienced frequent conflict with the expanding Arabic empire. Over the centuries of the middle ages, the Byzantine world contracted under the initial Arabic expansion, then expanded under two centuries of strong rulers, then contracted again, slowly, until it was overtaken by the Ottoman Turks in 1455.</p>

<p>So in the late eleventh century, on the eve of the crusades, it was the Byzantine empire rather than the Latin west that faced Arabic invaders. The Byzantine period of expansion and strong rulers had come to an end and, in the chaos, Arabic rulers attempted to expand into Byzantium.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Emissaries from Alexios I, the Byzantine emperor, came to pope Urban II in 1095 to ask for help defending the city of Constantinople. Urban II seized on this opportunity and, on November 27, 1095 he promulgated the first crusade in a <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html">famous speech.</a></p>

<p>However, Urban II and Alexios I had significantly different visions of what form western aid to the Byzantines should take. Alexios I wanted soldiers, who he would pay; the Byzantine armies like modern armies worked on a payment model. However, western European armies were feudal and land ownership was the foundation of wealth; soldiers were either rewarded with plunder from victories or, for the nobility, granted land for service. Cash payment would not appeal to the nobles who led the armies who fought for land. Alexios I would not have given his land to western European nobles. Urban II not only knew this, but was also deeply concerned about the violent squabbling between Christian rulers over arable land — most of which had been claimed by the late eleventh century.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Thus, rather than calling for volunteers to defend Constantinople as Alexios I had requested, Urban II called for soldiers to conquer the Holy Land. He thus addresses, in some way, the problem of Arabic incursions into Byzantium while also giving the nobility of Europe a new opportunity to gain territory without fighting against other Christians. It&rsquo;s certainly overly simplistic to see only mercenary reasons for the crusades, since the idea of regaining the Holy Land from the Muslims held significant emotional power as well. But under Urban II&rsquo;s vision of the crusades, most crusaders had a variety of motives for taking part: defeating Muslims, having knightly adventures, gaining land and treasure, earning a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm">plenary indulgence</a> for sins.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that Urban II hoped to reunite the western church and the eastern church, which had diverged in language, theology and hierarchy as the Roman empire dissolved in the west but only formally split in 1054 CE, recent history for Urban II. However, despite the first hundred years of largely successful crusading, the crusades ended up deepening divisions between the Byzantine empire and the west. The fourth crusade (1202-4) never even reached the Holy Land; instead, after becoming embroiled in political unrest in Constantinople, the unpaid western armies grew restless and plundered the city.</p>

<p>All of which to say: while the initial impetus for the crusades is the request from Byzantium for aid against Muslim invaders, the crusades were only partially, if at all, about defending Europe from the Muslims. In fact, shifting the objective of the first crusade from helping Constantinople to retaking the Holy Land suggests that western rulers weren&rsquo;t particularly concerned about either the fate of Constantinople or keeping Byzantium as a buffer between western Europe and the Arabic empire. Were crusaders motived by the desire to defend Christendom against Muslims? Probably many were. But they also wanted to <em>reclaim</em> or <em>expand</em> Christendom, and few would have seem themselves or their kingdoms as directly threatened by Muslims.</p>

<p>Moreover, remember that identity categories in the middle ages, as I discussed on Monday, could be fluid, complicating European views of Islam. Most western Europeans identified as Christian, a powerful pan-European identity that also linked western and Byzantine Christians. One could not, obviously, identify as both a Christian and a Muslim, and there are plentiful works of art and literature that sharply contrast Christian and Muslim. The twelfth-century <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/roland-ohag.asp"><em>Song of Roland</em></a>, for example, presents Muslims as completely evil and worshipping an unholy trinity made up of Mohammed, a demon named Termagant, and the Roman god Apollo. And when king Arthur&rsquo;s rebellious nephew/incestuous son Mordred (very ahistorically) allies with Saracens (a medieval term for Muslims), this proves the depth of Mordred&rsquo;s wickedness.</p>

</figure></p>

<p>And yet, European scholars had great respect for Arabic scholarship, particularly medical scholarship and commentaries on Aristotle. The Muslim ruler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin">Saladin</a> was greatly admired by the leaders of the Third Crusade — especially England&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England">Richard I</a> — even as their armies battled. And in the fourteenth century, the English travel writer John Mandeville unfavorably compared Christian nobles to Muslims, who he claimed more closely adhered to the ideals of chivalry and morality in general despite their ignorance of Christianity. These examples show that, despite the large religious divide, scholarship and chivalry provided points of contact between the Christian and Muslim worlds.</p>

<p>My goal in today&rsquo;s post has been to sketch the often complex relationship between the kingdoms of western Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Muslim world. These relationships were not, with some notable exceptions, always peaceful and harmonious. And because religious and ethnic identities were tightly connected, it is accurate in some senses to see a conflict between Christianity and Islam. And yet the crusades also brought about closer contact between western Europe and the Arabic empire, contact that enriched European scholarship and bridged cultural divides.</p>

<p>It is not historically accurate to imagine medieval Europe as united against an encroaching Islamic threat, or as striving to preserve its cultural heritage in the face of outside invaders. This notion overstates a united European identity, exaggerates the threat posed by the Arabic empire, and ignores the peaceful and productive exchanges of scholarship and culture between the Christian west and Islamic east at various times during the middle ages.</p>

<p>The medieval period is not the best model for modern-day relationships between majority Muslim and majority Christian nations. But neither do the middle ages provide proof that Christianity and Islam are incompatible and must remain locked in combat until one or the other disappears.</p>

<p>There were periodic Arabic raids along the Mediterranean, including in Marseille and coastal cities in Italy. Like the pagan Viking raids from the north, however, these were not attempts at imperial conquest but smash and grab operations.

<p>Last week, we began a series on white supremacy and the middle ages. I started with the notion that the middle ages were the dark ages (<a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">here</a>), since that idea makes it easy to abandon the middle ages to those who would use it to support their agenda of racial or cultural purity. As we discovered, however, the middle ages — far from being dark — play an important role in the development of western culture.</p>

<p>Last week&rsquo;s posts sketch how the middle ages, rather than being dark and ignorant, are instead a vital period in the development of western culture. But this is not a culture that leads inevitably to white supremacy. Today and Wednesday, I develop this argument along two lines: today, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the idea that Europe was racially homogenous in the middle ages; on Wednesday, I discuss the crusades and the idea that Europe was united in opposition to encroaching Islam.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s post on race is not going to be comprehensive, because I&rsquo;m not writing a book. I&rsquo;m including links at the bottom of the post for further reading on race and the middle ages for any who are interested — and I&rsquo;m going to plug the Tumblr <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com">People of Color in European Art History</a> up here as well, since the art curated there is worth thousands of words insisting that people of color did, in fact, exist in medieval Europe.</p>

<p>But before we turn to the middle ages, we need to start with the Enlightenment for a very specific reason: the eighteenth-century Enlightenment is when our modern notion of race emerged, and specifically the notion of whiteness against which all other races were measured (and found lacking). Human beings undoubtedly have noticed, categorized, and assigned value to differences throughout history, but cultures frame those differences in a variety of ways. Our modern framing of race, including our valuation of European whiteness as the standard from which other races diverge, comes not from biology or some vague feature of human nature or even ancient or medieval western culture, but from Enlightenment thinkers.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment scholars, as they studied the past, projected their ideas about race back onto the middle ages, constructing a purely white medieval Europe. And their legacy lingers: even today, and even among specialists who should know better, the focus is almost always on white figures. You can&rsquo;t get through a graduate degree with a medieval specialty without studying Thomas Aquinas or Dante — but you can (as I know from experience) get said degree without any study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">medieval Jewish thinkers</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Maurice">Saint Maurice</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes">Islamic scholars</a> of Sicily and Spain.</p>

<p>And this whitewashing of medieval history shows up even in pop culture representations — in the nearly all-white cast of <em>Game of Thrones,</em> for example, or the periodic grumbling about the BBC&rsquo;s colorblind casting policy in shows like <em>Merlin.</em> Or Tolkien&rsquo;s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a very medieval epic in which the only characters of color are barely-mentioned enemies of Gondor and the West.</p>

<p>Given both the contents of textbooks and the representations we see on screen, plus the assumption that the dark ages must have been ignorant and bigoted, it&rsquo;s no surprise that we assume that the middle ages were racially homogenous. But we should reexamine this assumption through two different lenses: first, the way that medieval people themselves thought about race; and second, the extent to which we can see homogeneity.</p>

<p>The first question is the most complex: how did medieval people think about race? The first thing to know is that Latin, the language of medieval scholarship, doesn&rsquo;t have a term that easily equates to what we mean by &ldquo;race&rdquo; today. Writers could use a few terms, such as <em>gens</em> — a word that can be most broadly translated &ldquo;people,&rdquo; but that can mean &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; or &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; with connotations of biological descent.</p>

<p><figure class="float-left">

</figure></p>

<p>As Christians, however, medieval European thinkers emphasized common descent from Adam. They also saw the natural environment as an important factor in creating different appearances, which means that physical appearance isn&rsquo;t always tied to race or biological descent. For example, because they believed that extreme heat causes the skin to darken, medieval thinkers thought that an African who relocated to Europe would become lighter-skinned, or see lighter-skinned descendants (the opposite would also be true — fair-skinned Europeans would darken in equatorial climates). From our modern point of view, this significantly misunderstands genetics. But it&rsquo;s also crucial to understand that the physical markers of modern-day race, like skin tone, were not seen by medieval people as barriers to assimilation into other cultures or as indications of character or mental ability.</p>

<p>Additionally, customs, language, and law were viewed by medieval people as key markers of racial or ethnic identity —  social, not biological, factors. Different language groups, what we might call different racial or ethnic groups, frequently coexisted within larger political entities, such as the various princedoms of the Holy Roman Empire or the Welsh and Scots in England. This means that many medieval people would have had complex and overlapping racial and ethnic identities.</p>

<p>These medieval thoughts about race and ethnicity demonstrate that, in the middle ages, &ldquo;race&rdquo; meant something rather different than it does today. And importantly, the idea of racial purity would probably not have made sense to medieval thinkers, since for them race and ethnicity are shaped by natural and social environments — change those, and ethnic identity can also change. One example is the <a href="https://theconversation.com/vikings-were-never-the-pure-bred-master-race-white-supremacists-like-to-portray-84455">Viking</a> settlement of Normandy (in modern-day France). Viking invasions along the Seine turned into settlements, and over time the Viking settlers intermarried with the original inhabitants and adopted the French language and French customs. Neither the Vikings nor the French seem to have been particularly concerned about racial purity or mixed ethnicities, despite facing the inevitable tensions that can arise when two different people groups begin to live together.</p>

<p>So for medieval people, race or ethnicity depended in part on descent, in part on geography, and in part on language, law and customs — a rather more complex and flexible definition of race or ethnicity than what arose in the Enlightenment.</p>

<p>But despite this medieval understanding of race, weren&rsquo;t the vast majority of people in Europe at the time just white?</p>

<p>Hopefully the discussion above has shown that medieval people wouldn&rsquo;t have viewed everyone in Europe as a homogenous race, given a diversity of climates, languages, laws and customs. Some homogenizing factors did, however, exist in Europe. Christianity is the crucial cultural unifier, which I will discuss more on Wednesday with the crusades. For the nobility, the laws of chivalry provided a pan-European identity,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the cultural explosion of the twelfth century saw certain styles of art and manuscript production (which we now call Gothic) spread across Europe and supplant more localized styles. But while these factors provided points of contact among European people groups, they did not produce a unified European ethnic identity.</p>

<p>Moreover, Europe had non-white inhabitants. In the Roman period, the Roman custom was to distribute armies across the empire — so North Africans served in England, Gauls in the middle east, etc. As Roman power waned, some of these soldiers undoubtedly remained where they were stationed, becoming absorbed into the population.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Jewish settlements also existed in many cities across Europe, with Jewish people living and working alongside their Christian neighbors but holding distinct languages, laws and customs. Similarly, both Sicily and Spain had Muslim communities that often existed alongside Christian and Jewish communities.</p>

<p>Additionally, Europeans traded with the known world: the Silk Road took merchants to the far east, spices and fables of a Christian kingdom came from India, and artistic influence flowed between southern Europe and west Africa. Travelers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo">Marco Polo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mandeville">John Mandeville</a> entertained audiences with tales of their travels — real travels, although highly embellished narratives. In the realm of fiction, foreign knights served in Arthur&rsquo;s fabled court: like the Saracen (Arabic) knight Palomides, a paragon of chivalry who only converts to Christianity as he dies, or the African <a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/morien.html">Sir Morian</a>, hero of his own Dutch romance.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that medieval Europeans valued diversity in a modern sense; that also recreates medieval Europe into our own image. But to imagine Europe in the middle ages as racially homogenous requires us to both ignore evidence to the contrary and to project Enlightenment ideas about race onto medieval people. And while medieval people were certainly quite capable of bigotry, their ideas and experiences of race certainly do not support the notion that medieval Europe is a model for white supremacy or white nationalism.</p>
