<p>It comes as a surprise to many that medieval women made substantial contributions to theology. Our popular image of the middle ages emphasizes its darkness and ignorance, which surely (we assume) includes the oppression of women. But medieval women did have avenues of influence in the church, and even the briefest survey of Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s life shows both her political and her theological influence.</p>

<p>Born in 1347, the year the plague swept into Europe, middle-class Catherine grew up to become an important figure in Italian politics and a mystic theologian. Accounts of her life report that she began having mystic visions as a child of 5 or 6, visions that continued throughout her life. But Catherine hardly secluded herself in order to experience these visions; she lived an active life both within her community and beyond it, in the realm of Italian politics.</p>

<p>When Catherine was 16, she refused a marriage her parents had attempted to arrange and instead became a tertiary in the Dominican order. A tertiary in a monastic order lives a life in accordance with the vows of monasticism (poverty, chastity, obedience) but does not actually take those vows. Catherine was probably attracted to living a monastic life without being secluded in a cloister, as she would have been were she a Dominican nun. She did, however, spend the next three years praying and fasting before she reemerged into public life.</p>

<p>From the time she was 19 until her early death at 33 (in 1380), Catherine served her community in a variety of ways. She worked with the poor and the sick, giving away her own food and tending plague victims. In her mid-20s, Catherine began to travel in Italy and to write letters to a variety of important Italians, offering advice and urging peace between warring Italian cities. Nearly 400 of these letters still survive. Even as she became involved in politics, however, her role was primarily that of a spiritual advisor, encouraging repentance and renewal.</p>

<p>As her influence in Italian politics grew, Catherine became involved in the complex politics around the Avignon Papacy. In 1309, long before Catherine&rsquo;s birth, the papacy had relocated from Rome to Avignon, France under pressure from French rulers. This move caused significant distress in the church, and Catherine&rsquo;s voice joined a chorus begging the pope to return to Rome. She herself travelled to Avignon in 1376 and met with Pope Gregory XI, where she urged him to return to Rome. Catherine was not the only influence in his decision, but Gregory XI did indeed return to Rome in 1377 — although much to Catherine&rsquo;s dismay, within a year this move precipitated a schism in the church, with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon.</p>

<p>In the brief period between the return of Gregory XI and the schism, Catherine produced her treatise, <em>The Dialogue.</em> She seems to have dictated much of it while having visions, but she likely learned to write in order to edit her own text.  Reading and writing were distinct skills in the middle ages, and Catherine seems to have relied on scribes to write while she dictated her letters. But she evidently wanted a greater degree of control over the text of <em>The Dialogue,</em> which points to its importance as a record of her mystical experiences.</p>

<p>Like most medieval mystic theology, <em>The Dialogue</em> both records Catherine&rsquo;s mystical visions and reflects theologically on them. Particularly striking imagery fills the conclusion, as Catherine uses an almost dizzying array of images and metaphors to describe God. In just a few paragraphs, God is the deep sea, a burning fire, the abyss, a craftsman, light, a mirror, and a garment. Through these images, Catherine attempts to describe her understanding of God in a spirit of humble awe at the revelations she has received. Her images pile up, overlap, some harmonious, some discordant — but all point towards the depth of God&rsquo;s love for humanity and the overwhelming but good nature of God.</p>

<p>Catherine died in 1380, physically worn down by years of fasting and deeply disappointed by the emerging schism in the church. Her life was short but full: in her brief 33 years, she meet with rulers and popes, persuading them to restore peace and return the papacy to its rightful home. But above all this, she frequently experienced the direct presence of God. Her <em>Dialogue</em> meditates on these experiences, attempting to explain the magnitude of God&rsquo;s love and the necessity of responding to it, despite our inability to ever reflect God.</p>

<p>Catherine was revered immediately upon her death, and sainted in 1461. And her legacy has continued: in 1970, Catherine was named a Doctor of the Church, an honor given to 36 men and women (currently) who made significant contributions to theology. Also, in 1999, Pope John Paul II named Catherine one of the six patron saints of Europe.</p>

<p>Despite her brief life, Catherine brilliantly exemplifies how we can combine the active and contemplative lives. Her involvement in both charity work close to home and Italian politics reflect her rich direct experiences with God as she strove to bring the peace and love of God to those around her, while urging them to respond to that peace and love with repentance and renewal.</p></div>

<p>By happy coincidence, last week I was reading both Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s <em>Delusions of Gender</em> and Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s essay collection <em>The Givenness of Things</em>, which begins with &ldquo;Humanism.&rdquo; In this essay, Robinson considers the limitations of neuroscience, which she describes as reducing the intricate complexity of the brain to &ldquo;an essentially simple thing.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This reduction, in Robinson&rsquo;s analysis, rejects the notion of the self and ultimately results in a devaluation of humanity.</p>

<p>Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s book is a little less intellectually lofty, but she also takes popular neuroscience to task, specifically for oversimplifying and overstating complex and often unclear results about differences between men and women. Fine&rsquo;s more narrow argument supports Robinson&rsquo;s larger point: when neuroscience is used to support sweeping generalizations about gender differences, both men and women are dehumanized, their potentials and limitations reduced to electrical impulses in their brains.</p>

<p>Fine argues, repeatedly, that a focus on the brain alone erases the many social factors that lead men and women to behave and respond differently — in other words, neuroscientists tend to study brains as isolated rather than embedded in complex social networks. Reading Fine in conjunction with Robinson, we can criticize the tendencies of neuroscience, or at the very least reporting on neuroscience, to ignore the impact of both sociology and the humanities on our understanding of the self.</p>

<p>But why does this tendency to view the brain in isolation from society and the humanities matter? After all, neuroscience has the very specific goal of discovering how the brain works in a mechanical sense, exploring topics like where and how emotions manifest and whether differences exist between male and female brains. Any area of study must have its limitations, and as Robinson points out the very nature of science over the last two hundred years or so bars it from asking metaphysical questions about the soul, or even the self.</p>

<p>Fine and Robinson both take different angles on the question of why the limited focus of neuroscience is a problem, but both broadly criticize it for its overreach, the tendency to take a specific test result and make sweeping generalities about human nature. For Fine, the overreach lies in how neuroscience affirms and entrenches our tired old stereotypes of women — with the veneer of objective scientific truth but without consideration of the effect of centuries of patriarchy. For Robinson, the overreach lies in oversimplification, the notion that we can understand humanity by tracing where the brain lights up in a scanner. Both authors resist the essentializing of ourselves to the mechanisms of our brains, or at least to those mechanisms described in simple, cause-and-effect terms.</p>

<p>Neuroscience is just the latest in an extensive human tendency to oversimplify and essentialize human beings. Long before brain scans and modern neuroscience, the author Charlotte Brontë warns against reducing complex individuals to the mere sum of their parts. In Brontë&rsquo;s novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Jane makes a passionate speech to Mr. Rochester in which she proclaims: &ldquo;Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you, — and full as much heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brontë may not have had brain scans, but she was familiar with the nineteenth-century methods of essentializing people by class and gender. Given the social norms of the day, the wealthy, upper-class, male Mr. Rochester had every reason to believe that poor, lower-class, female Jane was, indeed, lacking in soul and heart, lacking in those characteristics that make one fully human.</p>

<p>Jane&rsquo;s declaration reminds Mr. Rochester — and us, dear reader — that Jane herself, her desires and talents and emotions and capabilities, cannot be boiled down to her class, gender, and dare I say brain scans. Brontë&rsquo;s heart-wrenching narrative of Jane&rsquo;s childhood emphasizes her extraordinary passion and sensitivity despite an upbringing designed to squash those characteristics.</p>

<p>And so, despite all the inputs that should push her to develop a poor, mean character, Jane clings to a self that is kind, generous, <em>good</em>, a self that is shaped by her circumstances but not in a mechanical, cause-and-effect manner. Yet she knows that when people see her, they often see not her unique self but the presumed product of poverty, charity and femininity — a product endowed with less heart and soul than an upper-class man.</p>

<p>Neuroscience has a similar tendency, reducing the complex web of the self to a measurable series of stimuli and responses. Neuroscience has, to be sure, great value: for example, understanding how stress can reshape our brains can give us greater empathy for those who encounter the daily stress of poverty or racism.</p>

<p>But Robinson and Fine, along with all the great novelists, remind us that we cannot reduce humans to their brain chemistry. Social context matters greatly, especially since brain science is still in its infancy. Even social context, though, cannot fully account for the self. For that, we must turn to the humanities to understand what it means to have a soul, to have a heart — to have those qualities that poor, little, obscure Jane claims, qualities that make her an equal to any other human being.</p>

<p>I think most of would agree that our self is something more than the chemistry or electrical impulses in our physical brains. And to understand something as complex and metaphysical of the self, we must not limit ourselves to neuroscience. Instead, we must draw on the resources of social science and the humanities as we strive to understand what it means to be human.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about Harvey Weinstein. Not because I don&rsquo;t care, or don&rsquo;t believe the accusations, or have nothing to say, but because I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m not shocked. I&rsquo;m not surprised. I&rsquo;m horrified, of course, although that reaction is dulled by too many repetitions of the same story.</p>

<p>But with #MeToo trending on Twitter as I write today, I feel the need to say something. It&rsquo;s not going to be something profound. It&rsquo;s not going to be the something that suddenly changes things for women. But it&rsquo;s one more something on the mound of stories and arguments and pleas that, maybe, someday, will grow into change.</p>

<p>When I say me too, I know I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones: I&rsquo;ve never been sexually assaulted. Just harassed. Just made to feel uncomfortable, just grateful to the friends — men and women — who&rsquo;ve looked out for me over the years, walking me to my car at night, warning me about the too-friendly professor, watching my drink at the bar.</p>

<p>In other words, just a typical woman.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem: I don&rsquo;t know any woman who hasn&rsquo;t experienced harassment in some form. It&rsquo;s everywhere, but that also means it&rsquo;s nowhere. Invisible.</p>

<p>Something like the allegations about Harvey Weinstein break onto the scene, and everyone is horrified. For a while. But we all know the pattern, because it happens so often: we feel outrage, but it seldom translates into an examination of why this keeps happening.</p>

<p>We start to distance ourselves. We chalk assault up to Hollywood culture. We have a hard time reconciling a genial figure peddling pudding in dorky sweaters with a habitual user of date rape drugs. We dismiss crude language about assaulting women as locker-room talk.</p>

<p>We wonder why women don&rsquo;t speak up about their experiences sooner, or louder, or somehow better. We read <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kMJV4o">op-eds</a> that suggest this sort of harassment happens to pretty women, less conservative women, women with less protective parents. We make this a liberal problem (Weinstein) or a conservative one (Roger Ailes), a worldly problem (Hugh Hefner) or a religious one (Bill Gothard).</p>

<p>As women, we are told and we tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re too sensitive, we can&rsquo;t take a joke, we&rsquo;re imagining things, we should be flattered by the attention. If we&rsquo;re careful enough, if we smile and nod, if we wear the right things and say the right things we&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Besides, how often does that sort of thing <em>really</em> happen?</p>

<p>And before we know it, we&rsquo;re back to normal — and maybe a career has ended, but more often nothing much happens and nothing much changes.</p>

<p>If we want this cycle to change, we must confront the fact that, as a society, we value women less than men. We find their pain less important than men&rsquo;s reputations. We believe them less, we subject them to greater scrutiny, we hold them to impossibly high standards.</p>

<p>This happens in churches and faith-based organization and in Hollywood. In academia and service industries. On the coasts and in rural Iowa. In Silicon Valley, in hospitals, in the C-suite, in factories. Women are harassed and assaulted by strangers and trusted friends, by colleagues and intimate partners, by bosses and subordinates.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m tired of people being periodically horrified by high-profile instances of assault. I want people to be horrified that half the population has to deal with harassment on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I want outrage and official action over the professors who have inappropriate contact with their students, not just a whisper network among women.</p>

<p>I want the comedian who tells a rape joke to hear horrified gasps, not laughter.</p>

<p>I want the pastor who delivers sexist jokes from the pulpit to be corrected by his parishioners, not allowed to persist.</p>

<p>I want the manager who touches inappropriately to be reprimanded, not ignored.</p>

<p>I want the colleague who makes off-color remarks to be ostracized, not excused.</p>

<p>I want the phrase &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo; stricken from our vocabulary.</p>

<p>I want to stop feeling so damn thankful that I&rsquo;ve only been harassed, not assaulted.</p>

<p>But until we work up the will as a culture to value women as human beings whose worth is equal to men, none of what I want will happen.</p></div>

<p>(Spoilers throughout)</p>

<p>I watched <em>La La Land</em> for the first time last week. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sold: I was a little bored by the meet cute, the mutual dislike opener to the romantic relationship, the aspiring actress falling for the snobby, nostalgic lover of jazz. But the ending? That got to me.</p>

<p>I must confess that I&rsquo;m a sucker for the unresolved ending, the ending where plot threads dangle and the happily-ever-afters dissolve into uncertainty. And <em>La La Land</em> subverts the ending we expect of a romantic comedy in ways that underscore the tensions between individuals and relationships and highlight the loss that always comes with the choices we make.</p>

<p>In the final dream sequence of the film, we see Emma Stone&rsquo;s character (Mia) imagine a different path for her relationship with Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling). The power of this dream sequence is that we, the viewers, want it to be true: the conventional romantic narrative of the majority of the film sets us up to want Mia and Sebastian to get to happily ever after together. Sebastian living alone, Mia married to another man — these do no make for a Hollywood ending. The dream sequence feels right, feels like the ending we deserve.</p>

<p>And yet. The dream sequence is a fantasy: it waves away the conflict between Mia and Sebastian, and not just the initial romantic attraction disguised as repulsion. It erases Sebastian&rsquo;s time with the band, erases his failure to come to Mia&rsquo;s one-woman show, erases their separation when Mia goes to Paris to star in a movie … and erases Sebastian&rsquo;s successful opening of his dream jazz club.</p>

<p>This dream sequence underscores the vital tension in the film between the relationship and the individual dreams of Mia and Sebastian: they can&rsquo;t have it all. They can&rsquo;t have each other while also fulfilling their separate dreams.</p>

<p><em>La La Land</em> layers the expectation of romantic comedies — that the relationship prevails — with the other prevailing film expectation that the characters follow their individual dreams. Sebastian tells Mia not to turn down the film in Paris because of him, and she doesn&rsquo;t. She ends up with the successful acting career she wanted, as well as a husband and child with whom she seems very happy. And Sebastian doesn&rsquo;t find a romantic partner, but he remains close to his sister and her family as he launches his own jazz club.</p>

<p>They have followed their dreams, they are both happy — but the final sequence underscores the cost, highlights what could have been had they made different choices. The film doesn&rsquo;t suggest that they have made wrong choices; the final look between Mia and Sebastian contains acceptance, not unhappiness. But this look also acknowledges the inevitable loss of making a choice.</p>

<p>What is the cost of pursuing your own dreams, of valuing your individuality over relationships, or even a single relationship? Is the cost worth what you gain? <em>La La Land</em> doesn&rsquo;t answer these questions, refuses to answer these questions — at the end of the film, both the future that is and the future that could have been are good. But the film forces us to ask that question.</p>

<p>Unlike most romantic comedies, where the characters either do end up having it all or where any individual loss is minimized compared to the relationship, <em>La La Land</em> forces us to consider what we value and what we lose in our choices. The film presents no solution, no formula for making these calculations. But the power of the ending lies in its acknowledgement of loss, its realization of the cost of the always inevitable choice between individual and relationship.</p></div>

<p>After all the medieval history, today we take an autumn-appropriate breath with some Old English poetry. The poem partially quoted below, <em>The Ruin</em>, is an elegy, a lament for things lost. Old English poetry has a rich selection of elegies, and this is one of my favorites. It comes from a tenth-century manuscript known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Book">Exeter book</a>, the largest of only a few surviving collections of Old English literature.</p>

<p>The poem itself, in the tradition of an elegy, meditates on ruins and the inevitable decay of all earthly things. In a fittingly poetic twist, the manuscript itself is also damaged, leaving the poem about ruins in ruins.</p>

<p>In a season overrun with decorative gourds and pumpkin spice delicacies that distract us from the coming winter, it&rsquo;s worth reflecting for a moment on falls, on ends, on decay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wondrous is this wall&rsquo;s foundation – <em>wyrd</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has broken</p>

<p>and shattered this city; the work of giants crumbles.</p>

<p>The roofs are ruined, the towers toppled,</p>

<p>frost in the mortar has broken the gate,</p>

<p>torn and worn and shorn by the storm,</p>

<p>eaten through with age. The earth’s grasp</p>

<p>holds the builders, rotten, forgotten,</p>

<p>the hard grip of the ground, until a hundred</p>

<p>generations of men are gone.</p>

<p>This wall, rust-stained</p>

<p>and covered with moss, has endured one kingdom after another,</p>

<p>stood in the storm, steep and tall, then tumbled.</p>

<p>The foundation remains, felled by the weather,</p>

<p>it fell…..<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>grimly ground up ….</p>

<p>……cleverly created….</p>

<p>…… a crust of mud surrounded …</p>

<p>….. put together a swift</p>

<p>and subtle system of rings; one of great wisdom</p>

<p>wondrously bound the braces together with wires.</p></blockquote>

<p>The poem continues with descriptions of the inhabitants of this ruin, proud warriors who succumbed to plague and war despite their joy and bravery while they lived:</p>

<blockquote><p>The slain fell on all sides, plague-days came,</p>

<p>and death destroyed all the brave swordsmen;</p>

<p>the seats of their idols became empty wasteland,</p>

<p>the city crumbled, its re-builders collapsed</p>

<p>beside their shrines. So now these courts are empty,</p>

<p>and the rich vaults of the vermilion roofs</p>

<p>shed their tiles.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Unlike other Old English elegies, <em>The Ruin</em> has no explicitly Christian themes, no reference to the eternal nature of God. It&rsquo;s a poem about a lost civilization (most scholars connect it to the Roman ruins in modern-day Bath), and as such a reminder that all civilizations come to an end. Reading it today, in the twenty-first century, we have an added layer of poignancy: the author and his culture have crumbled into the ruins of history, the poem itself existing in ruins — a memorial, as were the Roman ruins, to those who produced them.</p>

<p>This probably seems like an odd way to end a series that attempts to reclaim the middle ages from those who would distort them in the service of damaging ideologies. And I could have chosen any number of other cultural relics that are more up-beat, more exemplary of the rich and diverse culture of the middle ages.</p>

<p>But at the beginning of this series, I talked about the culture wars as a fight to define and defend western culture — and those actions require that we also preserve western culture. Against this urge for preservation, this poem reminds us that all things end, all things decay; winter always comes, no matter how bountiful the harvest.</p>

<p>And yet something also always remains. The inhabitants of the ruins, like the author of the poem and the copyists of the manuscript, have vanished — but the ruins, the poem, the things themselves, they survive. There is loss, yes, but memory remains. An elegy can only exist if something is remembered, is valued enough to remember.</p>

<p>Change can feel like death, like loss. And I think it&rsquo;s obvious that western culture, especially after centuries of colonization and globalization, is changing. But all things end; this is the way of the world. We may mourn the end, elegize the great monuments of the past. But someday we too will be mourned and elegized by those who come after us.</p>

<p>This knowledge can free us from the need to preserve, from the need to prevent change. And as the seasons shift, let us take a moment to contemplate the transience of the world.</p>
