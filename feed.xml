<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the news this week with sadness and horror as the egregious police killing of a black man has erupted into protests, both peaceful and violent, across the nation. I feel sick watching, yet again, as a person of color is dehumanized, reduced to a threat, and treated as disposable by people in positions of authority.</p>

<p>And I feel sick watching the violence erupt, not just because of the violence but because of the pain and the rage behind the acts of destruction. This pain and rage has so often been actively dismissed or passively ignored until it causes an inconvenience — and then it is condemned. But dismissing, ignoring, and condemning those who cry out under injustice only exacerbates the pain.</p>

<p>And something feels different this time, for me and for many of my white friends. Maybe it&rsquo;s because police violence against people of color — and particularly black men — has displaced even a global pandemic in our news cycle. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because there have been so many deaths in the news in just the past few weeks, from Ahmaud Arbery to Breonna Taylor to Floyd George, plus the viral video of a woman telling the police that a black man was assaulting her when all he did was ask her to leash her dog in an area where dogs are required to be leashed.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m tired of the hesitation and caution that give my own cowardice a more palatable veneer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find excuses for that cowardice: I&rsquo;m white, I&rsquo;m still learning about racism in America, I don&rsquo;t want to say the wrong thing. I don&rsquo;t want to pick fights. I don&rsquo;t want to make it all about me. Truthfully, though, these excuses often mean: I don&rsquo;t want to make waves. I don&rsquo;t want to invite pushback or judgement that I could avoid by just keeping my mouth shut. I want validation that I&rsquo;m a Good White Person, instead of doing the work to actually be an anti-racist.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: racism is everywhere. We participate in it even when we don&rsquo;t actively choose to do so; it&rsquo;s an evil that must be actively resisted, at least in today&rsquo;s America.</p>

<p>And since I write as a Christian, racism an evil and a sin both individual and corporate. Racism is one of the powers and principalities that exist in opposition to the Kingdom of God. When churches and Christians fail to acknowledge their racism and their complicity in racism, they have given up in their fight against the powers of evil. They have abdicated the calling to love their neighbors. They have ignored the call to view others as better than themselves.</p>

<p>This is primarily a failing of white Christians in majority-white congregations, both evangelical and mainline — and given the segregation that exists in our churches, most white Christians in the U.S. worship in majority-white churches.</p>

<p>So, fellow white Christians, what do we do?</p>

<p><strong>We must listen to people of color describe their experiences, and we must be open to believing that their experiences are vastly different from ours.</strong> Especially for those of us who are white and middle-class, it&rsquo;s hard to hear that what we thought was a meritocracy is actually stacked in our favor.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Discomfort is valid, as all feelings are valid — but it doesn&rsquo;t negate the experiences our brothers and sisters of color have. Sit with that discomfort, work through it with friends who are a little further in their journey towards anti-racism, and learn to accept that discomfort is nearly inevitable when confronting the ways in which we participate in racist structures. Also, don&rsquo;t burden your friends of color with these feelings of white guilt! It is not their job to reassure you that you are one of the Good Ones or to absolve you of your discomfort.</p>

<p>Two books I have found helpful, particularly for describing the experience of black individuals in the church: <em>I&rsquo;m Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness</em> by Austin Channing Brown, and <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen: Changing the Way the Church Views Racism</em> by Drew G.I. Hart.</p>

<p><strong>We must learn when to humble ourselves and elevate the voices of people of color.</strong> Privilege gives people the expectation that their voice will be heard if they speak, and this expectation can be so deeply ingrained that we might not notice when we&rsquo;re speaking over or on behalf of those whose thoughts matter as much, or more, than our own. As a woman, I know how powerful it is (even though it&rsquo;s also infuriating) when a man amplifies my voice or creates a space for me to speak; those of us who are white should create space for others to speak.</p>

<p><strong>We must accept that we will make mistakes and be open to correction.</strong> This is a big one for me: I don&rsquo;t like looking foolish. I don&rsquo;t like making public mistakes. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve made many already in this (very long) post — and I know that criticism will sting.</p>

<p>But the alternatives are silence and defensiveness, neither of which address my own racism or the structural racism of my world. Losing power by being humble, being open to correction, and being willing to stay silent and listen is difficult at times. I love how Rachel Held Evans used to say that loss of power isn&rsquo;t persecution — but it is without doubt often uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>We must be willing to take action.</strong> Perhaps this means that you join a march or a demonstration. Maybe it means that you write your local sheriff or chief of police to ask what they are doing to prevent police violence. It could be researching candidates' positions on racial issues when it&rsquo;s time to vote — and being willing to let those positions effect how you vote.</p>

<p>Action definitely includes educating yourself — reading books like <em>The History of White People</em> by Nell Irvin Painter or <em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em> by Isabel Wilkerson, or listening to podcasts like NPR&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/"><em>Code Switch.</em></a></p>

<p>And action also involves a willingness to point out racism or raise uncomfortable questions, like why that candidate of color doesn&rsquo;t seem to &ldquo;mesh as well with the company culture&rdquo; as the white candidate. We can&rsquo;t be, and shouldn&rsquo;t want to be, white saviors; we need to take action carefully and in ways that reflect the actual needs and concerns of people of color in our communities or organizations. But we white people built racism; we benefit from racism; we have the power to perpetuate it — and that means we also have the power to dismantle it.</p>

<p><strong>And finally, for those of us with younger children, we must raise our children to see racism — and we must help them de-center whiteness.</strong> I find the second part simpler: my girls are avid readers, and I make sure that they read books by people of color and books with protagonists that don&rsquo;t look like them. I&rsquo;m not as good at making sure they see diversity in their shows, but I want to make sure that they don&rsquo;t assume that every hero shares their skin color — or assume that they can&rsquo;t identify with characters of different races. Middle grade books are, slowly, improving on this front, but we as parents need to be proactive. <a href="https://diversebooks.org">This website</a> is a helpful starting point in finding more diverse books.</p>

<p>Making my kids aware of racism is harder. I stumble over these conversations, both because I don&rsquo;t quite know how to explain police brutality to an 8-year-old and because I don&rsquo;t want to crush their innocence. I don&rsquo;t want them to know that the world can be such an awful place — and, because they&rsquo;re unlikely to experience racism first-hand, I don&rsquo;t need to open their eyes to this dark side of our society.</p>

<p>But the truth is, my oldest daughter has a friend who is black and 12 years old, just like Tamir Rice. He already knows how ugly people can be towards black boys; how can my daughter be a good friend if she doesn&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>A quick google search will bring up many, many resources for talking to your kids about racism. In my experience, though, preparing for a single big conversation isn&rsquo;t helpful — instead, we need to be willing to talk to our kids about racism whenever it may come up and however awkward we may feel. When everyone is talking about Trayvon Martin. When they wonder about a friend of color. When it&rsquo;s Black History Month and they come home thinking that Martin Luther King Jr. ended racism. When you watch a show together and see stereotypes or damaging portrayals.</p>

<p>We must perform the very Christ-like action of setting aside our privilege and power for the benefit of others. This command is for every follower of Christ, but I don&rsquo;t believe that we can lay down our power until we acknowledge that we have it, which is this case means acknowledging our complicity in racist structures in the U.S.</p>

<p>Privilege is complicated and intersectional, but 1) if you&rsquo;re new or slightly resistant to the idea of privilege, I highly recommend [this essay][3] by John Scalzi explaining privilege through the metaphor of video games; and 2) it&rsquo;s not particularly useful to play oppression olympics; every individual is different. But generally speaking, the path to success for a white person in America has significantly fewer potholes and detours that the path for a person of color.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <title>The Fifth Week in Lent: The Raising of Lazarus</title>

<p><em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+11%3A1-45&amp;version=NIV">Click here</a> to access this week&rsquo;s passage — John 11:1-45 — which is worth reading but probably longer than what I wrote below!</em></p>

<p>I named my blog &ldquo;Into Resurrection&rdquo; because the idea that Jesus is the resurrection <em>now,</em> that the kingdom of God is breaking in all around us <em>now,</em> has been transformative to my faith. It means that I&rsquo;m not just waiting for some future salvation, but that I&rsquo;m watching for the places where God is working salvation in the present. It means that I&rsquo;m not just saved <em>from</em> something (hell), but saved <em>for</em> something, for working towards building God&rsquo;s kingdom in the world around me.</p>

<p>There are plenty of theological clarifications and nuances I could make here, not least of which is the constant tension between looking for God&rsquo;s kingdom now and also hoping for its full arrival later — and the question then raised of how our work now fits into the coming kingdom.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, believing that Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life right now, in ways that directly impact my life and the lives of those around me, has given me immense hope and peace.</p>

<p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprising that I love today&rsquo;s gospel passage, John&rsquo;s account of the resurrection of Lazarus.</p>

<p>Of course I love the story of resurrection literally breaking into the world, as Jesus calls Lazarus out of the tomb. But what I most appreciate about this story is how it reflects the tension between the already and the not-yet, how it fully acknowledges the pain and grief of the not-yet-fully-redeemed world while simultaneously showing us the glorious hope of the resurrection.</p>

<p>Famously, this story of Lazarus contains the shortest verse in the bible: Jesus wept. Just two words; a factoid tucked away by every kid who competed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RUwkdqtO2M">sword drills</a>. But these two words are incredibly profound. Think about it: Jesus already knew that Lazarus was dead. And Jesus also already knew that he was going to raise Lazarus from the dead. But instead of telling Mary to buck up, instead of telling the mourners to stop, Jesus sits down with them and weeps.</p>

<p>What a profound acknowledgement of the pain, suffering, and grief we experience now. Jesus doesn&rsquo;t try to diminish or deny any of that — and in fact, Lazarus isn&rsquo;t resurrected into a happily-ever-after but into death threats as an associate of Jesus. Our tears have not yet been wiped away; death still occurs; we do not live in the fully-realized kingdom of God.</p>

<p>And yet. And yet. Lazarus does hear Jesus' call, does emerge from the grave back into life, back into the arms of his sisters and friends. Resurrection has come, the kingdom has broken into this household of Martha and Mary, this village of Bethany.</p>

<p>Last week, I <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2020/03/fourth-lent">wrote</a> about being a non-anxious presence in the world. This hope of resurrection, not just the future hope but the present hope of seeing it break into the world around us, sustains our non-anxious presence.</p>

<p>We aren&rsquo;t surprised by brokenness and grief; we know that Jesus is weeping alongside us. But we also expect God to show up as we look for resurrection life all around us. We can&rsquo;t stop this resurrection any more than we can stop the robins from returning and the first crocuses from blooming.</p>

<p>In the liturgical year, as in our lives, we are moving through Lent, through lament and suffering and pain and brokenness. We live in a world where Lazarus dies and his sisters weep. But Easter has come and is coming. Jesus defeated sin and suffering and death, and will defeat them once and for all.</p>

<p>And so, because of resurrection, as we live as resurrection people, we live with hope.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Fourth Week in Lent: Psalm 23</title>

<blockquote><p>The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not be in want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures
and leads me beside still waters.
He revives my soul
and guides me along right pathways for his Name&rsquo;s sake.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil;
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me;
you have anointed my head with oil,
and my cup is running over.
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been avoiding writing all month, uncertain of what will come out when I start putting my thoughts to (virtual) paper. My bishop, Todd Hunter, very wisely encourages both clergy and laypeople to practice being a &ldquo;non-anxious presence:&rdquo; God is always already at work in the world around us, and so not only do we not need to worry ourselves, we ought to actively resist the anxiety and fear in the world around us.</p>

<p>I love this idea. I want to work towards it. But how in the world do I hang on to this non-anxiety in the midst of a global pandemic? How can I be this non-anxious presence?</p>

<p>Several things are helping me control my anxiety: my meds, of course; yoga; long breaks from social media; the field full of robins I saw on a walk last week; connecting with friends, even if we can&rsquo;t be together in person; making space to pray the daily office.</p>

<p>But this week, we also have the liturgical gift of Psalm 23 in the lectionary.</p>

<p>This psalm is likely one of the best known passages of scripture. Familiarity can sometimes obscure fresh understanding, but this week at least I found the familiarity comforting; as so much is new and so much changes, the timelessness of this ancient poem soothed my heart.</p>

<p>And so this week, as I reflect on the lectionary, I&rsquo;m not offering exegesis or even fresh insight. Instead, I offer this psalm as an invitation.</p>

<p>An invitation to remember that God is our shepherd, the good shepherd who cares for the sheep: even amidst the anxiety caused by the less-than-reassuring responses of our elected leaders, God does not abandon us.</p>

<p>An invitation to remember that the valley of the shadow of death is just as real as the green pastures and still waters, and that sometimes we&rsquo;re not in the sunny field but the dark and terrifying valley. But the Shepherd is with us every bit as much in that valley as in the field.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where I can&rsquo;t resist making a connection to Lent: during this season, we remember Jesus' suffering — and we&rsquo;re nearly to Holy Week, when we walk alongside Jesus during the final week before his death and resurrection. But remembering Jesus' suffering isn&rsquo;t meant to simply make us feel bad that God went through all of that for us.</p>

<p>No: Jesus' suffering should fill us with gratitude, yes, but also hope, because our God became a human being and walked among us. When Jesus the Good Shepherd walks alongside us in the valley of the shadow of death, he can comfort us <em>because he too walked through that valley.</em> And we have hope because he also walked out of the valley, and will lead us out as well.</p>

<p>Finally, Psalm 23 invites us to remember that this is not the end, that we will dwell with God forever. I want to be clear: this shouldn&rsquo;t make us dismissive or fatalistic, and it certainly shouldn&rsquo;t make us ignore the dark valley. But we can live non-anxiously now <em>because we know it&rsquo;s not the end of the story.</em></p>

<p>This is a dark and frightening time. Many people are suffering and will suffer, because of illness or financial hardship. It&rsquo;s hard to say how much things will change when we come out from the other side of this pandemic. Everything, from grocery shopping to planning for the future, is wrapped in uncertainty.</p>

<p>But Psalm 23 reassures us that we have a God who doesn&rsquo;t let us walk on our own, who doesn&rsquo;t just promise to wait for us at the end. No, the Good Shepherd walks alongside us with the love and compassion that comes from having himself walked through suffering and death, having himself experienced anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still anxious, I&rsquo;m not going to lie. I&rsquo;m not to the point of easily being a non-anxious presence to those around me. But this psalm guides me to remember that God is still here, still with me, no matter what happens.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Fifth Week after Epiphany: Matthew 5:13-20</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>This week, the lectionary brings us into the Sermon on the Mount:</p>

<blockquote><p>“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.</p>

<p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>—Matthew 5:13-20, NIV</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I have a hard time with this passage. For me, it&rsquo;s wrapped up with the Evangelical culture war and with the narratives of (Christian) American exceptionalism that I was taught growing up. America was the City on a Hill, shining for all the world to see; in the era of the Moral Majority, being salt very often meant acquiring political power.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there&rsquo;s the terrifying prospect of the salt losing its saltiness: what does that mean? how does it happen? As an anxiety-prone perfectionist, this felt like a threat from a God just waiting to be disappointed in me (a topic for another day …)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure, though, that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t mean to encourage either political power grabs or existential despair.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to be salt? To be light? And why follow this with a discussion of the law?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/different-from-and-good-to-kevin-miller">his sermon</a> this week, my rector made two helpful points that I&rsquo;m going to steal. First, he pointed out that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t tell us to become salt and light; he tells us that we <em>already are</em> salt and light. Yes, Jesus tells us to not lose our saltiness or hide our light. But for me, the emphasis shifts to how we use what we already have, instead of how we get or keep these characteristics.</p>

<p>Second, he titled his sermon &ldquo;Different From and Good To.&rdquo; Salt and light are different from other things — but they are meant to do good. Light, for example, is different from darkness, but it is good: it allows people to see where they are going or what they are doing. I very much appreciate this emphasis on how salt and light are good for the things around them.</p>

<p>So as followers of Jesus, we are salt and light, and we are meant to do good to our surroundings. (And although Jesus didn&rsquo;t say this, shining strongly and unexpectedly is little better than hiding the light — as I was reminded a few nights ago when my bedroom light mysteriously turned itself on at 2 am, disrupting the rest of my night …)</p>

<p>After this exhortation, however, Jesus veers into what seems at first to be a completely new topic: how he is coming not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. Clearly, there&rsquo;s a lot going on in these verses: what is the &ldquo;everything&rdquo; that Jesus plans to accomplish? What does it mean to have a righteousness that surpasses that of the Pharisees, the very people who clung most strongly to their identity as the people of God?</p>

<p>But with these words, Jesus wants to remind his audience about the covenants God made with Abraham and Isaac, covenants promising that all nations would be blessed through their offspring. About the laws given to Moses that command the people of Israel to treat the immigrant and the traveller well. About the prophets who chastise Israel for its failures to be good to even those within its borders, let alone those beyond them.</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s people have been meant to be salt and light since the beginning: they are meant to be good for the world around them. And the law and the prophets referenced by Jesus give us an idea of what being good for the world looks like. It looks like caring for the poor, the orphan and the widow. Like ensuring that justice is done. Like refusing to allow the wealthy to abuse and exploit the poor and powerless.</p>

<p>William Temple, an Anglican priest of the early twentieth century, is said to have claimed, &ldquo;The Church is the only institution that exists primarily for the benefit of those who are not its members.&rdquo; Clearly, this is sometimes more and other times less true of the Church. But Temple has hit on something vital. The church, as a community and as individuals, should bring God&rsquo;s goodness to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be salt and light? It means to love mercy, do justice, and walk humbly with God. It means to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>Light in an already bright room is pointless; salt in a container in the cupboard has done nothing good. But when we as God&rsquo;s people are light and salt for those who need it, then the nations of the world are blessed through us.</p>]]></description>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lectionary passage comes not from Matthew but from the Gospel of John:</p>

<blockquote><p>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.”</p>

<p>Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”</p>

<p>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</p>

<p>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.”</p>

<p>So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter).</p>

<p>— John 1:29-42, NIV</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot happening in this passage: John mentions Jesus' baptism (the subject of <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2020/01/baptism-of-our-lord">last week&rsquo;s lectionary</a> reading); John declares that Jesus is the Lamb of God on whom the Spirit of God has rested; some of John&rsquo;s disciples turn to Jesus, one of whom is Andrew; Andrew invites his brother, Simon, to come meet the man he believes is the Messiah.</p>

<p>In short: we could talk about baptism, about Jesus as the lamb, about following Jesus, and about evangelism. A rich passage indeed.</p>

<p>But one thing struck me in particular: twice John names Jesus as the &ldquo;Lamb of God.&rdquo; The first time John elaborates, describing the moment of Jesus' baptism. And in both this elaboration and in the first naming, John emphasizes that he did not know that Jesus was &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Chosen One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This constellation of statements fascinates me. Why does John the Evangelist emphasize both that Jesus is the Lamb of God <em>and</em> that John the Baptist did not at first recognize Jesus as the one coming after him?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious that John&rsquo;s surprise has something to do with Jesus as Messiah and Lamb. Because just like <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2020/01/epiphany">the Magi at Epiphany</a>, we expect a king to be, well, kingly. Born in a palace. Strong in battle. Charismatic. And if we&rsquo;re going to choose an animal to represent those qualities, we&rsquo;re not going to chose a lamb.</p>

<p>But this image of the Lamb who is also a king forms the central image in another text written by John the Evangelist. In Revelation 4 and 5, John has the central vision of God enthroned, surrounded by worshipping angels and elders. As chapter 5 begins, John writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p>

<p>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus is <em>simultaneously</em> the Lion and the Lamb, the King who conquers sin and evil and death by humbling himself in the Incarnation, by submitting himself to human suffering and death.</p>

<p>This should be shocking. It seems to have surprised John the Baptist; in the lectionary passage, he now recognizes Jesus as the Lamb of God who is the Chosen One of God — but it took a direct sign from God for John to see this truth about Jesus.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawn for quite some time to stories about <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/tags/subversion">subversion in scripture</a>, stories where what we expect is reversed. Typically, the character who is weaker, or younger, or generally less powerful is favored by God over the stronger, more powerful character. Once you start looking, this pattern repeats all throughout the bible.</p>

<p>And Jesus is the ultimate subversion: God become a human being — and a human being in a normal family in an Israel ruled by a colonialist foreign power. The most powerful being in the universe, the creator and king, becomes a lamb — and more, a sacrificial lamb.</p>

<p>This should, without question, mean that Christians have a radically different conception of power than anyone else. The one being in the universe who is fully entitled to claim all power and authority, who has the power to demand all allegiance, chose instead to live and die as a human being subject to the oppressive power of imperial Rome.</p>

<p>And yet Jesus' power remained in the weakness. Ultimately, by dying he conquered death itself: a far more significant victory than dethroning a single Roman emperor. A victory that could only be won by a king who is also a lamb.</p>

<p>This is something different, something new. Something a little frightening that upends our categories for thinking about the world.</p>

<p>Like John the Baptist and Andrew and, although he doesn&rsquo;t know it yet in this passage, Simon Peter, we who are captivated by this Lamb who is a conquering king can do no better than to point to him. Look, the Lamb of God. Look, the Chosen One of God. Come and see the Messiah.</p>

<p>Because is there anything more amazing and more hopeful than a conquering king who is also a gentle lamb, a savior who lives and suffers and dies with us in order to bring us salvation from sin and evil and death?</p>]]></description>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m trying a new thing on the blog, something to keep me writing every week and to help me think through the weekly lectionary readings: writing on the Gospel passage for each week. We&rsquo;re in Year A, which means that most passages come from the Gospel of Matthew; this week, the passage is the baptism of Jesus by John in the Jordan River.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>John the Baptizer preached: “I baptize with water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am—so much greater that I’m not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire.”</p>

<p>Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. But John tried to talk him out of it. “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why are you coming to me?”</p>

<p>But Jesus said, “It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires.” So John agreed to baptize him.</p>

<p>After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy.”</p>

<p>— Matthew 3:11-17, NLT</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of those passages that is so familiar to me that I forget how startling the story is. Here is John, calling his audience to repent because the Kingdom of God is at hand. He exhorts them to repent, to turn away from their old way of life towards a new one, and be baptized in the Jordan River, symbolically re-crossing into the Promised Land.</p>

<p>John is acutely aware that his job is to prepare people to receive this coming kingdom of God — not to bring that kingdom into existence; that job belongs to Jesus. And yet, here comes Jesus, asking to be baptized by John.</p>

<p>In Matthew&rsquo;s version of the baptism, John protests, asking why Jesus is coming for baptism. John&rsquo;s question sparks others: why should Jesus be baptized when he has nothing of which to repent? And why should he submit himself to John&rsquo;s lesser baptism of water when he is bringing the baptism of the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p>There are many possible answers to these questions, answers that overlap or enrich each other. We could see Jesus as submitting to God, functioning as a true Israelite, as the one who reverses Adam&rsquo;s sin — the point of baptism being obedience, not repentance.</p>

<p>In another angle, one commentator I read pointed out that the Greek word for &ldquo;repent&rdquo; connotes a turning or change; Jesus did not have to turn away from sin, but his baptism marks a change in his life as after this moment he begins his public ministry (<em>Feasting on the Word</em> p. 239).</p>

<p>But I am particularly drawn to thinking about the deep and rich symbolism of water: God&rsquo;s spirit broods over the water as creation begins. God destroys the earth with water. God nourishes the Israelites in the desert by providing water from a stone. God destroys the Egyptian army in water. God leads the Israelites through the Jordan River into a new home.</p>

<p>Water is life. Water is also death.</p>

<p>So what does it mean that Jesus, the living water incarnate, allows John to submerge him in the water of the Jordan?</p>

<p>Jesus' baptism initiates his ministry, a ministry that ends in his death, burial, and resurrection. As St. Paul tells us in both <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:3-5&amp;version=NIV">Romans</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+2%3A11-12&amp;version=NLT">Colossians</a>, in baptism we are buried with Christ and raised to new life; the baptism at the beginning of his ministry mingles together the waters of death and of life, foreshadowing Jesus' defeat of death through death.</p>

<p>Water destroys evil; in baptism, we die to sin and evil and death. Water is life; in baptism, we are raised to eternal life in Christ. Water marks a passage from the old into the new; in baptism, we are marked as Christ&rsquo;s own people.</p>

<p>And when Jesus is dipped into the Jordan River by his cousin John, the Living Water encounters and transforms the waters of cleansing and initiation and death. Now through baptism, we die to the life of sin and live into the life of Christ. Because when the Living Water becomes flesh, becomes a particular person in a particular time and place, all that he touches is transformed and infused with new meaning.</p>

<p>In his baptism, Jesus foreshadows his death and resurrection. But he also gives us a powerful symbol. When the water of baptism flows over us, and then whenever we see another person baptized, we are reminded to repent, to turn towards Jesus, and enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s 2020! As I was considering what to do with this space, I had an epiphany of sorts (see what I did there?): I want to get more practice preaching, but I don&rsquo;t have a place to preach on a regular basis (my kids are a less than enthusiastic audience …). So what if I use this space to write a weekly reflection on the lectionary readings?</em></p>

<p><em>So, starting today, each Monday the blog will feature a reflection on the lectionary readings (from the <a href="http://lectionarypage.net">Revised Common Lectionary</a>) for the previous Sunday. These pieces aren&rsquo;t sermons, but they will give me a way to think about a particular passage each week. And today I get to cheat a bit, since I did <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/the-light-has-come-sarah-lindsay">actually preach last Saturday</a> on the Epiphany texts.</em></p>

<p><em>I will still write on other topics; those will go up on most Thursdays — although this week, my monthly newsletter will go out on Thursday, so <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ede0b4433b84/sarah-lindsay">sign up now</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet done so!</em></p>

<p>Today is the Feast of Epiphany, a feast in the liturgical calendar that marks the end of the Christmas season (the twelve days of Christmas) and commemorates the visit of the Magi to Bethlehem, an event that reveals Jesus as messiah and king.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been Anglican, I&rsquo;ve grown to deeply appreciate the rhythms of the liturgical year: rhythms that take us through the story of Jesus every year, and more than that rhythms that build in blocks of time for fasting and for feasting, for acknowledging our need for a Savior and celebrating the in-breaking reality of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>But I must confess: Christmas is hard for me to celebrate. Maybe it&rsquo;s the weather; we celebrate the Light coming into the world, but here in Chicago at least we have months more of cold and dark. Maybe it&rsquo;s cultural; growing up, the Christmas tree always came down on January 1.</p>

<p>Maybe, though, it&rsquo;s because I often find that celebration requires as much discipline as fasting.</p>

<p>A discipline of celebration feels counterintuitive: shouldn&rsquo;t celebration be spontaneous, or at least effortless? But especially when it comes to rejoicing that our Savior is born and lived and died and rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, I think that discipline is necessary. It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the ways that God is at work in the world around us, the ways that the kingdom of heaven is already breaking into the world. And so we must train ourselves to see and rejoice in the kingdom of God as it exists right now.</p>

<p>This is where the story of the Magi visiting the Christ child helps our discipline of celebration by pointing to what the kingdom of God looks like now.</p>

<p>First, the kingdom of God is a kingdom for everyone. The story of the Magi is so familiar to us that we forget, I think, how surprising it is that Matthew tells not of Jewish shepherds visiting the messiah — thematically appropriate characters, given that King David was a shepherd and God is constantly called the Shepherd of Israel — but of astrologers from a distant land.</p>

<p>Matthew is, of course, maddeningly vague about who the Magi are, where they come from, and what sort of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; they practice, although it must include astronomy and astrology (indistinguishable disciplines in the ancient world). But this is because none of that actually matters: what matters is that God sent a sign to people in a distant land and, through that sign, they were convinced that they needed to come pay homage to this new King of the Jews.</p>

<p>The Magi tell us, from the very beginning of Jesus' story, that God&rsquo;s kingdom isn&rsquo;t limited geographically; its inhabitants need not be any particular ethnicity. All that is required is to acknowledge Jesus as king — and this is very good news for us still.</p>

<p>Second, the kingdom of God can be found in unexpected places, and in places far removed from seats of worldly power. The Magi, quite naturally, assume that the king of the Jews would have been born in Jerusalem, in the palace of Herod. But instead, Jesus was born a normal child, in a family with no particular wealth or power, in a town of little political importance.</p>

<p>This is good news for us because it reminds us that we do not enter the kingdom of God via worldly power. God&rsquo;s power is not the power of wealth, political influence, or military might — and we do not need that power to gain the kingdom. We don&rsquo;t need to seek that power or place our hopes in those who wield those powers; that is not where the kingdom of God is found.</p>

<p>Third, even though the kingdom seems small and insignificant, its impact is anything but small. The birth of Jesus, although it was a cataclysmic event that reshaped human history <em>because the God who created us became one of us, became a part of the creation,</em> was not noticed by Herod or the scholars in Jerusalem. And yes, there was a sign in the stars — but only a few Magi, it seems, found it significant enough to undertake a long, expensive, dangerous journey to find the prophesied king.</p>

<p>But look at the effect: a group of people who upended their lives to come worship a king. And Matthew tells us nothing more of the Magi after they leave Bethlehem, but it hardly seems possible that their lives were ever the same again.</p>

<p>And isn&rsquo;t this always the way of the kingdom? Jesus says in Mathew 13 that the kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, like yeast: incredibly small, nearly invisible — but capable of a huge effect. The mustard seed grows into a huge plant, providing a home for many birds; the yeast works through the dough and produces food for many people.</p>

<p>This is where we return to the discipline of celebration: celebrating the coming of Jesus, the in-breaking of his kingdom, means looking for signs of the kingdom. It means seeing that the kingdom is for everyone, that it stands opposed to the power structures of the world, that it is constantly at work even when it seems invisible.</p>

<p>The discipline of celebration is thus a discipline of hope, of choosing to see the light even when the days are short and the nights long. And we can be inspired and encouraged by the Magi, who gave up their time, wealth, and even safety because they believed that the King whose star they saw was worthy of their sacrifice and homage.</p>]]></description>

            <title>'More Buddhist than Baptist:' Christianity and Truth-Claims</title>

</figure></p>

<p>Last week, I was listening to an <a href="https://jayshetty.me/shazam/">interview with Zachary Levi</a>, star of <em>Chuck</em> (I&rsquo;m still angry about how that show ended) and, most recently, the DC film <em>Shazam.</em> It&rsquo;s a great interview; Levi talks about therapy, mental health, trust, gratitude, prayer, and his faith. I hadn&rsquo;t known that Levi is a Christian, but he spends a lot of this interview talking about how important his faith is to him.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always a pleasant surprise to hear a Hollywood celebrity passionate about their relationship with God, but one thing struck me in particular: as Levi described his Christianity, he said that it is &ldquo;closer to Buddhist than Baptist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This line struck me because it encapsulates what I sometimes do when I talk about my faith. I&rsquo;m a Christian, yes, but not <em>that</em> kind of Christian. I distance myself in particular from evangelical Christianity, the strain of American Christianity that constantly struggles with fundamentalism, mires itself in culture wars, and all too often confuses political power with the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>I partly do this because I have theological values and convictions that don&rsquo;t mesh neatly with evangelicalism. But, let&rsquo;s be honest: I also partly do it because I don&rsquo;t want people to judge me. I don&rsquo;t want people to think that I support conversion therapy and screaming at women entering Planned Parenthood clinics, that I deny climate change and think God appointed Trump as our president and might still be iffy on interracial marriage.</p>

<p>I know that the above is a caricature, or at the very least representative of a minority of American evangelicals. And I have no compunction over distancing myself from the actions and rhetoric of that minority of evangelical Christians (<em>cough</em>Franklin Graham<em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>But I did grow up thinking that Christians were being persecuted in America. I was told that wavering on points of dogma was the same as rejecting Christianity. I believed that &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; especially pop culture, was separate from and even opposed to Christianity.</p>

<p>And then I discovered that actually, Christians disagree — have disagreed — about dogmas for centuries. I learned that Christianity is still culturally normative in America (with decreasing strength, but even Trump had to claim some form of Christian faith in order to win the presidency).</p>

<p>I even discovered that many &ldquo;secular&rdquo; cultural productions have deeply Christian themes (hello, <em>Harry Potter</em>) and that sometimes, culture is ahead of the church (#MeToo gave rise to #ChurchToo, not the other way around).</p>

<p>And as I threw off the baggage of the evangelical culture wars, I found myself more and more often making some version of Levi&rsquo;s statement: I&rsquo;m a Christian, but not like those crazy Baptists/fundamentalists/evangelicals over there.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s the line? What&rsquo;s the point where I say: yes, I do believe that, even though it&rsquo;s unpopular. When I say: my faith does require me to take this stand, to reject that belief, to criticize those decisions.</p>

<p>I led youth worship recently, and we talked about the tension between believing that Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life and living in a society that embraces, to at least some extent, religious pluralism. Religious pluralism asserts that all religions have some truth, so can&rsquo;t everyone just coexist?</p>

<p>And regardless of whether anyone truly believes that religions are neutral or basically equal, religious pluralism certainly promotes respect and dialogue. (Whether it achieves those things is, of course, an entirely different question.) But that&rsquo;s the rub: how do you simultaneously assert that your faith is True — while also respecting that others disagree for a variety of reasons?</p>

<p>In the churches I grew up in, I didn&rsquo;t learn much respect for non-Christians; the assumption tended to be that they were either too ignorant to see its truth or that they willfully rejected the truth.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;more Buddhist than Baptist&rdquo; approach pulls back from any truth claims about Christianity, reducing it to a personal faith that has little to offer the world and few distinctive elements. Zachary Levi certainly finds strength and meaning in his faith, but it&rsquo;s not clear that he thinks others would as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any answers on how to thread the needle. But I wonder: what if we invite people into the great story of redemption? What if we invite people to taste and see that God is good?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to prove that the story is true. We don&rsquo;t need need to demand that people make a wholesale intellectual commitment.</p>

<p>But the story of Christianity, of God&rsquo;s love for the world God made, of Jesus coming to laugh and cry and sleep and eat and die with us, of the Spirit dwelling within us, is so much bigger than personal feelings of well-being. This is a story worth inviting others into.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not always sure that God is making all things new, righting all wrongs, drying all tears. Sometimes it seems like a story that&rsquo;s far too good to be true. But if it is true? It&rsquo;s the most beautiful story and I want a place in it. So I believe, not because I know that Jesus is the Way, but because I hope he is.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be more Buddhist than Baptist, or the other way around. I want to say yes to God&rsquo;s story and to live as if God&rsquo;s story is true. And more: I want to live out God&rsquo;s story in my own life and invite others to live in this story with me.</p>

<p>And yes, sometimes that might mean that I have to take an unpopular stand. Sometimes it means that I see God&rsquo;s story woven into the world around me. But maybe it&rsquo;s not about drawing lines, about dividing in and out; maybe it&rsquo;s just about the invitation into story about God&rsquo;s love for us.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mower Against Gardens</title>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working a lot in my gardens over the summer: pulling weeds, pruning shrubs, spreading endless wheelbarrow loads of mulch. And, naturally, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the poetry of Andrew Marvell, particularly &ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens.&rdquo; Marvell is rivaled only by John Milton as the best English poet of the late seventeenth century, and his poems on gardens contain themes of Eden, formal gardens, breeding hybrid plants, the untamed beauty of nature, and the fleeting joy of wandering solitary in nature.</p>

<p>(I know, I&rsquo;m a literature nerd. But I love these poems that think about the relationship of humanity to nature pre-industrial revolution; Wordsworth&rsquo;s nature poetry is lovely, for example, but I&rsquo;m wary of the often sharply drawn dichotomies between [bad] industry and urbanization and [good] untouched nature.)</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48333/the-mower-against-gardens">&ldquo;The Mower Against Gardens&rdquo;</a> the speaker — the mower — complains about the unnaturalness of formal gardens, with their expensive flowers, grafted trees, and hybrid plants. The mower contrasts this with the wild meadows, watched over by benevolent Nature and populated by &ldquo;fauns and fairies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the irony here is that the mower, armed with his scythe, tends to both the meadow and the garden: cutting down the grass, pruning the trees, exerting human dominance (dominion?) over both spaces. And both the garden and the meadow as the mower describes are imaginary: no gods dwell in the meadows, and nature, hardly absent from the garden, instead thrives there thanks to human cultivation.</p>

<p>Although the mower highlights the dichotomy between the cultivated garden and the wild meadow, Marvell suggests that both are spaces where humans tend nature, their responsibility since God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and where humans come into conflict with nature, their curse since the Fall.</p>

<p>Both the conflict and the joy of responsibility ring true for me, as I find both deep satisfaction and profound frustration as I tend my garden.</p>

<p>I have a shrub by my front porch, and I love the deep green leaves that welcome everyone who comes to my front door. But I also have to fight it, pruning it back every year as its branches threaten to grow over the walkway and block, rather than welcome, those who walk up the pathway.</p>

<p>I feel a deep satisfaction when I clear the weeds from a flower bed, allowing my plants to flourish free from competing thistles and clover. But I also feel a sense of despair, since I know that I will have to do this again, and again. And I know that now the rabbits will have unfettered access to the tender leaves of my new plants. My sweat drips into the soil as I fight nature in order to tend it.</p>

<p>And I wonder: how much of this work is good? How much is broken by the Fall? One of the things broken in the Fall was the relationship between humanity and the natural world; it is now marked by struggle and exploitation rather than harmony and care. Marvell points to this in his poem as people twist nature to fit into unnatural forms. But even so, the mower exists to keep nature from taking over fields and dwellings; the mower, despite his spoken stance in the poem, is an antagonist to nature.</p>

<p>In the Gospels, Jesus repeatedly uses the figure of the farmer in his parables. These agricultural illustrations would certainly have resonated with his non-industrialized audience. But I can&rsquo;t help but think that Jesus' use of nature is more profound: our struggle to both care for and protect ourselves from the natural world is one of the oldest struggles faced by humanity.</p>

<p>I think of the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds, found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+13%3A24-30&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s gospel</a>, where the farmer sows good seed but the enemy comes in the night to sow weeds. When both come up, the servants despair: what are they to do about the weeds growing up entwined with the wheat? The farmer says: let them both grow together. Let the good and the bad intermingle because it can be difficult to distinguish between the two; because rooting out the bad can damage the good; because the struggle can make the wheat stronger.</p>

<p>Just like Marvell&rsquo;s mower, the farmer in this parable complicates the dichotomies we like to draw: natural and unnatural, good and bad, wheat and weed. My work in my gardens is a microcosm of my work in life, as I try to do good but sometimes cause harm, as I do work that must be repeated over and over and over again.</p>

<p>None of this invalidates the work. But our struggle with the natural world, even in as small a setting as the flowerbeds around my house, is one of the primal struggles faced by human beings. We can take hope in knowing that, in the end, the Farmer will separate out the wheat and the weeds. But until that day, we work in mixed ways in this mixed world.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Being a Woman in a Dual-Integrity Denomination</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>The question shocked me for a moment, not because it was offensive but because no one has asked it of me before: what is it like to be a woman in a dual-integrity denomination, in an organization where some leaders do not recognize women&rsquo;s ordination as valid and where women are barred from the highest levels of leadership?</p>

<p>This question was asked of me and the three other women in a seminary course held around the <a href="https://www.teloscollective.com">Telos Collective</a> conference on Anglican missiology and ecclesiology. (The Telos Collective is a missional organization with the Anglican Church in North America [ACNA] that is led by my own bishop, Todd Hunter. I&rsquo;m not writing about Todd, but he is the real deal. After spending just a few hours with him during the conference, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be in his diocese.)</p>

<p>For those of you not versed in the ACNA, two years ago it decided to allow bishops to choose whether or not they would ordain women, and to what level they would ordain women. Around a quarter of the bishops will ordain women to the priesthood, but women are barred from becoming bishops. And this is still a point of contention, with many unhappy that the ACNA ordains women at all. I wrote about the ACNA&rsquo;s decision to be a dual-integrity denomination <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-11-2017-ACNA">here.</a></p>

<p>The man who asked us what it is like to pursue ordination in this organization is not part of the ACNA; he came from a tradition with women at all levels of leadership. I appreciated his acknowledgement of the challenges we face and, even more, the space he created for us to share our stories with the men who have power but not the visceral experience of being a woman in the ACNA.</p>

<p>I certainly had opinions at the time and I did share them. But I keep thinking about this question and I want to write down my thoughts, because as much as I value unity in the church and as much as I appreciate the leaders — male and female — who have encouraged me as I move into church leadership, I sometimes struggle with being a woman in a denomination where some would deny the call I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.</p>

<p>Being a woman in a dual-integrity denomination means never being sure whether I will be fully welcome in certain spaces or if I will, instead, be asked to make myself lesser in order to be accepted.</p>

<p>It means knowing that my peers and other leaders in the denomination deny my experience of a call to ministry, and likely to the priesthood, on the sole basis of my gender, not on any actual knowledge of me as a person.</p>

<p>It means not being represented at the highest levels of leadership. I don&rsquo;t have models of women bishops. And, no matter how sympathetic my male bishop may be to the women in his diocese, he does not have the experience and perspective of a woman and so the policies that he and other bishops shape lack direct imput from the women who make up at least half of their congregations.</p>

<p>It means feeling like I have to be grateful for what I&rsquo;ve been given and not make waves about wanting more. And I am grateful for male allies, since they do have power and influence. But I hate that my status is contingent on men deciding whether or not I should have it.</p>

<p>It means that, because I have to be grateful, it&rsquo;s difficult to call out the deeply-rooted sexism that still exists even in dioceses and churches that ordain women. I don&rsquo;t see this in my church very much, but often people think that simply supporting women&rsquo;s ordination in theory is good enough; they don&rsquo;t actively seek to encourage, include, and mentor women into leadership positions in their churches.</p>

<p>It means being made secondary to unity. People on both sides of the question point out that women&rsquo;s ordination isn&rsquo;t a credal issue, so we should be able to let it go. But I am not secondary. I am a person, created in the image of God just like my male peers. And I resent that my ability to serve God as God has called me might be curtailed in the name of unity — unity which is mostly about peace-keeping among male leaders at the expense of women.</p>

<p>All of this sounds very angry feminist, and I won&rsquo;t deny that there is some anger (and plenty of feminism). But I can live and work and seek ordination in the ACNA as a dual-integrity organization; I&rsquo;m not leaving because some bishops wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my (hypothetical) ordination as valid. This space is significantly better than many others, than the churches of my youth that wholly denied women&rsquo;s ordination.</p>

<p>But I also am not going to pretend that this is good enough.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the men who have advocated for my right to ordination. I value unity in the church. But I do not want my daughters, the girls in my church&rsquo;s youth group, or the college women attending my church to feel pressure to be grateful for partial inclusion and to endure being made into a secondary issue for the sake of unity, which feels a lot like being a secondary person.</p>

<p>And so I am going to keep explaining why this isn&rsquo;t good enough, to keep advocating for women&rsquo;s full inclusion at every level from lay leadership all the way up to bishop. I understand that it will take time. But I hope I can see the day when no one is excluded from any level of service in the ACNA on the basis of their gender alone.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Remembering Rachel Held Evans</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to write this post for the last week, but I&rsquo;ve dreaded writing it, too. How do I write a remembrance of someone I met once, briefly, in a signing line at a conference? How do I mourn someone who was a mentor, a pastor, an elder sister, even though she never knew my name?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how, to be honest. But Rachel Held Evans was precisely the voice I needed in my faith journey and I&rsquo;m devastated that she cannot continue to point the way, to comfort and provoke, to show the love of God to hundreds and thousands of people through her words.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to write about how Rachel Held Evans influenced my life, so that my story can add to the many others in a memorial to her faithful ministry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m almost exactly the same age as Rachel: both of us were born in the summer of 1981, which makes us either very young Gen Xers or very old Millennials. Both of us were raised in the subculture of the evangelical church — I could have given her a run for her money in Sword Drills — and both of us, in our early 20s, began to be dissatisfied with evangelical Christianity.</p>

<p>For me, that discomfort arose in the context of graduate school at a state university. For the first time, I was outside of the (very small) bubble of the homeschooling world and the (slightly larger) bubble of my evangelical college. I was becoming friends with people who were Catholic and mainline Protestant and Jewish and agnostic and I was spending time with kind, compassionate, moral people who weren&rsquo;t Christians.</p>

<p>More, I wasn&rsquo;t persecuted or even ridiculed for my faith, as I had been told I would likely be; I didn&rsquo;t need the apologetics I had learned. In fact, it was my agnostic friends who taught me how to listen with respect to other beliefs as they asked me genuine questions about my faith.</p>

<p>In addition, feminist theory was making more and more sense to me. And when my first daughter was born in 2009, I realized that I was indeed a feminist: I was ambivalent about advocating for myself, but when I looked into her tiny, perfect face I knew that I would do everything in my power to protect her from the destructive effects of the patriarchy.</p>

<p>Secular universities, agnostic friends, and feminists had all been presented as dangers (or conversion opportunities) in my evangelical subculture. But in the university, building friendships with agnostic feminists, I began to wonder: what else might evangelical Christianity have gotten wrong? But what would it look like to be a Christian without being an evangelical?</p>

<p>This is when I first found Rachel Held Evan&rsquo;s blog. I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when or how; it was before <em>A Year of Biblical Womanhood</em> was published, so perhaps 2010 or so. And she was asking the questions I was asking: can Christians be feminists, accept evolution, even (gasp) vote for democrats? Can we leave behind the legalistic dogma of evangelicalism while still loving Jesus and seeing scripture as inspired?</p>

<p>As it turns out, a whole lot of us were asking these questions. And Rachel, with her humor and honesty and vulnerability, quickly became a leading voice — a mentor, a pastor — among those of us who wanted to learn how to love God and love our neighbor and care about the environment and support egalitarian theology and work towards social justice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one of the many people who kept their faith because of Rachel&rsquo;s work. But she helped me to articulate my discomfort with some aspects of the evangelical church and, most importantly, she showed me that I could seek to be a faithful follower of Jesus even as I rejected many of the teachings I had grown up with.</p>

<p>Because of Rachel Held Evans, I can read Proverbs 31 without cringing and without despairing of ever being a &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; woman.</p>

<p>Because of Rachel Held Evans, I can better sift what is essential (as an Anglican, the Creeds) and what is non-essential (like a literal seven-day creation).</p>

<p>And because of Rachel Held Evans, I haven&rsquo;t spiraled into anger and bitterness (or at least, not as much as I could have). Rachel was bold, but never cruel. She once said — perhaps on an episode of <em>The Liturgists</em> podcast — that she would gladly receive communion with a person who was, at the time, attacking her on social media. She said, simply, that he was a brother in Christ, so of course she would take communion with him.</p>

<p>This continues to challenge me. It&rsquo;s easy, when we leave something behind, to decide that it was all bad, to want to burn it behind us. To want to treat others as they have treated us, questioning our salvation when we depart from evangelical dogma and cutting us out of the community.</p>

<p>But Rachel challenged, and continues to challenge, me to be more charitable. To remember that there was much good in the evangelical subculture. To recognize others as my brothers and sisters in Christ even when we disagree strongly.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that she&rsquo;s gone so soon, that she won&rsquo;t be with me through her words as I continue to work out my faith. It seems wrong and unfair: why her, when she was so loved and loving, when she helped so many of us stay with Jesus even as we walked through the wilderness?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why her. I don&rsquo;t understand why she died so soon. I&rsquo;m angry and sad and stunned. But here&rsquo;s what I do know: because of Rachel Held Evans, my faith is stronger and deeper and richer. And because of Rachel Held Evans, I found freedom and found my voice so that I, too, can help point people to Christ and to the rich freedom and community of life lived in the hope of the resurrection.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Women in Christianity: Julian of Norwich</title>

<p>When I was 20 and spending a year studying in Oxford, I had a crisis of faith.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since realized that my experience was hardly unique; I was in a new environment, exposed to new ideas and people, figuring out who I was and who I could be in the world. Reevaluating my relationship to Christianity seems, in retrospect, perfectly normal in those circumstances.</p>

<p>But at the time, I experienced quite a bit of distress. (I was also, I now realize, in the middle of a major depressive episode which certainly amplified my emotions around my faith.) I wrestled with what I believed; I even tried not believing in God. My thoughts and emotions were a tangled mess and I didn&rsquo;t know what I should believe.</p>

<p>I was in this state when, in late April, I finished my program at Oxford and set off to backpack through Europe. As I travelled, I sat in beautiful churches in every city I visited. Ancient churches, famous churches, small churches, one in Barcelona whose name I&rsquo;ve forgotten but whose stone cloisters contrasted beautifully with the brilliant green trees.</p>

<p>And in those churches, I met God. Not intellectually. Not through scripture or sermons. Not even in answers to the questions I&rsquo;d been asking for months. Instead, in the deep peace of those buildings where saints had worshipped for centuries, I felt God&rsquo;s presence and God&rsquo;s peace.</p>

<p>Meeting God in this way moved me profoundly and has anchored me over the years as I continue to wrestle with what it means to be a Christian. But meeting God in this way, in an inexplicable sense of peace and presence, also startled me. In the evangelical (and dispensational) churches of my childhood, faith was primarily intellectual, a matter of believing the right things about God; attending a Christian liberal arts college did little to challenge this approach to faith.</p>

<p>(Plus which, I had absorbed the idea that it was better to be rational than emotional; especially as a woman, I strove to be intellectual rather than driven by feelings. Yay for false dichotomies and internalized misogyny.)</p>

<p>This suprarational experience of feeling God&rsquo;s presence and peace during those weeks of backpacking has shaped my faith ever since. My eyes opened to an entirely new way of knowing God: I still value intellectual knowledge, but adding experiential and mystical knowledge helps me remember that faith is about knowing God, not knowing all the answers.</p>

<p>This may seem like an odd preamble to a post about Julian of Norwich. But she is one of my favorite mystics (let&rsquo;s be honest, my favorite mystic), and I love her in part because she holds together mystical and intellectual knowledge. When she was 30 and deathly ill, she had a series of visions. She recovered, and spent years afterwards writing theological analysis of those visions.</p>

<p>Julian, living in pre-modern England, did not separate intellectual and mystical knowledge of God in the way that we, living in a post-Enlightenment world, so often do. For her, and for many other medieval mystics, mystic theology and scholastic (intellectual) theology were two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Julian&rsquo;s <em>Revelations</em> are theologically dense and intellectually rigorous expositions of her singular mystical experience. Unlike other mystics of her era, Julian only had the one vision — and although we don&rsquo;t know exactly when she finished her <em>Revelations</em> or even when she died, we do know that she lived for many years after her visions and all of her surviving writing is a theological framework for and extrapolation of her vision.</p>

<p>There are many other fascinating aspects of Julian&rsquo;s life — for example, she was an anchoress, a woman who chose to live a monastic life in a tiny, door-less room build onto the side of a church. From this room, Julian could look into the church to see the mass and receive the Eucharist; she could also talk out of her window to townspeople and even tourists who came to her for spiritual advice.</p>

<p>And her theology is fascinating as well: she emphasizes, over and over, God&rsquo;s love for creation, love that continues in the midst of sin and suffering and evil. Julian&rsquo;s famous phrase — &ldquo;All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well&rdquo; — is a profound affirmation that God will, out of love, restore all things and make all things new.</p>

<p>Julian also uses beautiful feminine language to describe God as a loving, nurturing mother. She is not the only medieval mystic to write about God as mother, but the picture of God that emerges from her <em>Revelations</em> is one that highlights God as one who nurtures and loves unconditionally.</p>

<p>Primarily, though, I came to love Julian because she gave me a language and a theological framework that bring together my experience of God and my cerebral theology. She reminds me that we know God in our hearts and our minds, our bodies and our thoughts — and that when intellectual approaches to our faith fall short, God can still be present with us.</p>

<li><p>Veronica Mary Rolf&rsquo;s recent <em>An Explorer&rsquo;s Guide to Julian of Norwich</em> is a helpful introduction to Julian, her world, and the major themes of her writing. Be aware, however, that Rolf significantly overstates both the exceptionality and the danger of writing mystical theology in Middle English (rather than Latin) as a woman. By Julian&rsquo;s era of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, significant precedent existed for mystical theology written in Middle English, such as <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> and works by Richard Rolle. Moreover, mystical theology was the one field of theology open to women, since it is based on experience rather than the university studies that were closed to women.</p></li>
<li><p>Robyn Cadwallader&rsquo;s <em>The Anchoress</em> is not about Julian of Norwich, but it is a lovely novel about a young women who becomes an anchoress in medieval England.</p></li>

<p>In the liturgical year of the church, we have entered the season of Eastertide: fifty days — a week of weeks — during which we celebrate the Resurrection. We spent the forty days of Lent fasting and repenting, remembering our need for a Savior; we now spend even longer rejoicing that our Savior has come.</p>

<p>Each week from now through early June, those of us in liturgical traditions will start every worship service with this greeting and response: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen! He is risen indeed! Alleluia!</p>

<p>But what does it look like to celebrate resurrection?</p>

<p>Jesus' resurrection is his defeat of sin and death and evil. It is the promise that we, too, will be resurrected; that Jesus defeated death not only for himself but for all of us. When we proclaim the resurrection we proclaim the audacious hope that God is making all things new, restoring all things, bringing the kingdom of heaven into being.</p>

<p>Sometimes resurrection looks like miracles and renewal, broken things made whole, battles won. It looks like Aslan, light shining from his mane, breathing new life into dead stones, crushing evil.</p>

<p>But sometimes resurrection is Frodo and Sam, trudging into the barren darkness of Mordor with only a tiny spark of hope. Resurrection is dancing in the aisle at at Easter even as you weep for the loss of someone you love. Resurrection is taking your medications and making your millionth PB&amp;J and planting annuals in the spring.</p>

<p>Resurrection means clinging to the hope, the crazy, beautiful hope, that all of this — pain, joy, suffering — is being redeemed, is given meaning by the resurrection of God-become-human, of Jesus.</p>

<p>I want resurrection to be big and glorious, to be Aslan driving back the White Witch. But mostly, resurrection isn&rsquo;t like that. It&rsquo;s small and easy to miss. It&rsquo;s a pot of tea shared by friends on a cold day. It&rsquo;s a sympathetic word for the parent with a tired toddler in the grocery store. It&rsquo;s saying something kind when you want to be cutting.</p>

<p>Resurrection is carrying that spark of hope even when everything is bleak. Not a hope that ignores the darkness, but a hope that the risen Christ will — in fact, has — overcome the darkness.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why we celebrate Easter for fifty days. It&rsquo;s easy enough to sustain this hope for a day, especially a day filled with sweet breads and chocolate bunnies. But to celebrate the resurrection for seven weeks takes discipline and a commitment to carrying hope and Easter light into our ordinary lives.</p>

<p>This Eastertide, then, let us celebrate resurrection. Maybe we&rsquo;re like Lucy, and celebration is easy as we ride, breathless with joy, on Aslan&rsquo;s back. Maybe we&rsquo;re Samwise, desperately weary, barely able to remember anything green and living. Likely, we&rsquo;re somewhere in between. But whether or not the hope of resurrection comes easily, let us speak into our lives, our neighborhoods, our world: Alleluia! The Lord is Risen!</p>

<p>And let us listen carefully to hear that he is risen indeed. Alleluia.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Advent 2: Peace</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>Last week was the second week of Advent, so throughout the week we lit the candle of peace alongside the candle of hope. This second candle is also the candle of the holy family.</p>

<p>With hope and the prophets, the connection is clear. But what about peace and the holy family? If anything, the coming of Jesus disrupted their peace: the peace of Mary&rsquo;s life, when she accepts her supernatural pregnancy and all of its possible consequences; the peace of Joseph&rsquo;s life, as he learns that his betrothed will have child that is not his own; the peace of their small family, as Jesus is born at an inconvenient time and as the political consequences of bearing a king forces the young family to flee their country as refugees.</p>

<p>As I was thinking about peace this week, though, I began thinking about how sin manifests in broken relationships between people and how the peace that Jesus brings can heal those relationships.</p>

<p>Peace is not just the absence of conflict, whether neighbors ignoring each other as they carefully mow to the edge of their lawn or nations existing in a state of uneasy détente. True peace is not agreeing to disagree while silently looking down on a friend, nor is it constantly stifling rage and frustration to exchange banal pleasantries.</p>

<p>Instead, peace brings healing and restoration, understanding and compassion. This type of peace can weather conflict, and even exist during disagreements; this peace recognizes the dignity of others by honoring their status as beloved children of God. This peace brings unity without forcing uniformity.</p>

<p>This peace, the peace that Jesus promises, is the remedy for sin that disrupts our relationships with each other and with God. It&rsquo;s deeper and richer and, yes, much harder to achieve than mere pleasantness or forced conformity. It&rsquo;s a peace that exceeds the ability of fallen humanity, a peace available only through God.</p>

<p>And that brings us back to the holy family. God supernaturally restores peace between Joseph and Mary: Joseph, feeling betrayed by the woman he was to marry; Mary, surely fearful that her unwed pregnancy will erase her place in her community. But God brings them together, brings peace into their relationship, as they come together to raise the Son of God.</p>

<p>We see this peace in Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s relationship only in small glimpses: as Joseph takes Mary and Jesus to Egypt, fleeing Herod; as Mary and Joseph search, both frantic, for their 12-year-old son in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Did Joseph fully believe, fully understand who his son was? We have no way of knowing for sure. But we can see the peace of God at work in his life as he builds a life with Mary, with Jesus, with the other children that arrived. A peace that restored and preserved relationships that otherwise would have fractured.</p>

<p>I like to think about Mary at Advent: her willingness to become the mother of God, her passionate <em>magnificat,</em> the way she hides all the marvels and ponders them in her heart. But Joseph, too, shows a willingness to let God transform his life and rebuild what seemed to be destroyed when he learned that Mary was pregnant with a child not his own.</p>

<p>Peace will look different in each of our lives, as each of us has relationships broken and strained in different ways and each of us tends to harm others in different ways.</p>

<p>But this Advent season, may the peace of Christ dwell richly in us as the body of Christ, so that we can know the power of Jesus to heal the effects of sin in our communities.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;m a week behind on Advent (not to mention the last six weeks of silence on the blog). But every year, I find Advent more and more meaningful. These four Sundays leading up to Christmas invite us into the tension between the already and the not yet, darkness and light, sorrow and joy.</p>

<p>Christmas can often seem like a season where we have to be jolly and bright, pretending that everything is fine so we can create perfect family memories. But Advent says: there is darkness, and pain, and sorrow, and waiting, and longing. The answer has come and is coming, but the longing remains.</p>

<p>In the first week of Advent, we light the candle of hope, or the candle of the prophets. This candle reminds us that even in the darkness, we can see the light of Christ. It may be small, or distant, or unclear; Isaiah could not clearly see the great light for the people in darkness. But the darkness does not overcome the light. In fact, in the darkness, we come to appreciate the light more than we would in the day.</p>

<p>The past two weeks have been especially full of darkness for me. Nothing beyond the ordinary tragedies of human existence: a friend who lost her mother, another friend who received a serious diagnosis, my own struggle against the fog of depression. But the pain and the sorrow, the longing for things to be different, have loomed large as my Advent season begins.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m conditioned, by years of consumerism and Hallmark sentiments, to feel that I&rsquo;m doing something wrong if I don&rsquo;t enter December with joy and anticipation and a list of fun family activities. Weeping angrily over suffering isn&rsquo;t precisely photogenic, nor is cocooning myself in blankets while my kids fight over Christmas music.</p>

<p>But the hard parts of life don&rsquo;t just vanish because we put the lights on the tree and hang the stockings on the mantel. The suffering and longing remains, even if we try to bury it under tinsel and trips to see Santa.</p>

<p>Celebrating Advent, though, creates space for us to feel both the sorrow and the joy. Advent acknowledges the pain and suffering in our lives, and then points us to hope, to light, to life, to the child in the manger.</p>

<p>Advent means that we can attend a funeral one day, shedding tears and grieving with friends, and take the kids Christmas shopping the next, delighting in their excitement and joy. Advent means that we cry angry tears over the friend diagnosed with an illness and then joyful tears as the candlelight spreads during the Christmas Eve service.</p>

<p>Advent says: you are waiting and longing for your Savior — and behold, he is coming. Make the paths straight, the mountains and valleys level, because our hope is not in vain.</p>

<p>The prophets of old clung to this truth just as we still cling to it. We hope, not because all is already as it should be, but because we know the world is not yet made right. We hope because we believe in the advent of the One who will make all things new, wipe away every tear, heal every ill.</p>

<p>And so we light this first advent candle, the candle of hope, the candle of the prophets, with longing and joy in our hearts.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;m at the Evolving Faith Conference this weekend, hosted in the mountains of North Carolina by Sarah Bessey and Rachel Held Evans (I met Sarah Bessey today, and I fangirled a little bit). I&rsquo;m a bit burned out after hearing so many fascinating talks from fascinating people (and having fascinating conversations with a friend I don&rsquo;t see often enough).</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not writing much; I&rsquo;m not sure I can formulate many cohesive sentences tonight. But I was struck by how the speakers, ranging from Pete Enns to Wil Gafney to Jen Hatmaker to Osheta Moore, kept returning to a theme of lament.</p>

<p>Lament for friendships lost, for conceptions of God lost. Lament for the pain and isolation of experiencing a deconstruction of faith. Lament for the hurt and sorrow caused by faith communities both personally and in the world through patriarchy and white supremacy.</p>

<p>But each speaker also affirmed that, out of this sorrow and pain and loneliness, we can find God again, even in places where we didn&rsquo;t expect to find God. We can find community. We can regain, regrow a faith that is deeper, more resilient. We can rediscover hope in the peace and justice of God.</p>

<p>We can find hope in knowing that we are God&rsquo;s beloved.</p>

<p>My journey of deconstruction and reconstruction hasn&rsquo;t been particularly dramatic; it&rsquo;s been slow, and I&rsquo;ve been blessed with community along the way. I haven&rsquo;t experienced a dramatic break or a traumatic expulsion from a community of faith. But even as I&rsquo;ve intellectually wrestled with various doctrines, part of my heart has always been afraid to engage, afraid of God&rsquo;s rejection and disappointment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working — I&rsquo;ve been working for the last year — to integrate my head and my heart. And I keep hearing (as I wrote last week) the word that I am beloved.</p>

<p>Hearing the speakers today, I was reassured that I am beloved. That if I earnestly seek God, I will find God. That God is never disappointed in my questions and confusion and sin and even anger.</p>

<p>And that, right there, is the gospel. All I can hope to do is to immerse myself more and more fully into this truth.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Victimhood as Weapon and the Power of Justice</title>

<h4>Weaponizing Victimhood</h4>

<p>A few weeks ago, around the time of the Kavanaugh hearing, I saw a post shared on Facebook. This post started by expressing sympathy for victims of sexual assault, but then began to criticize women who &ldquo;weaponize their victimhood&rdquo; in order to hurt others — in this case, Brett Kavanaugh. Weaponized victimhood is, according to this poster, fake or exaggerated victimhood that then creates a real victim: not the sexually assaulted woman, but the man faced with the possibility of being held accountable for his actions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I was struck by the idea that victimhood can be weaponized, and just a few days later I heard this idea again from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LZ3P1sv9jE">Trevor Noah.</a> In this clip, Noah describes Trump weaponizing victimhood: &ldquo;He [Trump] knows how to offer victimhood to those who have the least claim to it,&rdquo; allowing men to see themselves as the real victims of the #MeToo movement, rather than the women coming forward with accounts of sexual harassment and assault.</p>

<p>I was struck by the way that, despite their deep differences, the two positions both emphasize the power of victimhood.</p>

<p>This emphasis on the power of victimhood shed some new light on a critique I often heard in my conservative home of so-called &ldquo;victim mentality.&rdquo; Those with this mentality, I was told, imagined slights in order to claim certain benefits, like restaurant patrons planting hairs in their soup to gain free meals. In this view, many women, minorities and people in poverty were scamming the system — gaining power — by portraying themselves as victims instead of doing the proper American thing and bootstrapping themselves into success.</p>

<p>And what is the power of these victims? Why is victimhood either coveted or denounced? After all — filers of frivolous lawsuits aside — who would want to be a victim? Who would want to be sexually assaulted or racially profiled? Who would want to be trapped in cycles of poverty?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The power, or perceived power, of victims lies in their call for justice. To announce oneself as a victim is to demand justice: a powerful call in a nation founded on the idea of liberty and justice for all.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h4>The Power of Justice</h4>

<p>I imagine that Trevor Noah, the writer of the Facebook post, and the conservative adults of my childhood would all agree that justice is important, even vital to the success of America and American democracy. But crucially, they disagree over who gets justice.</p>

<p>Does Christine Blasey Ford get justice, or Brett Kavanaugh? The women raising their voices in the #MeToo movement, or the (few) men who are falsely accused?</p>

<p>The problem with justice is, often, like the problem of fairness for my children: they are all for fairness when it benefits them, but not so much in favor of fairness when it doesn&rsquo;t. We want justice when it suits us or benefits us, but not when justice&rsquo;s scales might tip against us.</p>

<p>Take reparations, for example: there&rsquo;s a compelling argument to be made that black Americans deserve recompense for centuries of slavery and Jim Crow, centuries that have prevented black Americans from accumulating wealth at anything approaching the level of white Americans. Justice, in this argument, would require not just the granting of legal equality but also financial reparations to right past injustices.</p>

<p>But even someone like me, who can agree with this argument in the abstract, feels uncomfortable with the thought of this justice touching my pocketbook: after all, I have an ancestor who enlisted in the Union army at the age of 16! How can it be justice for me to give my money to right a wrong that I never caused?</p>

<p>Claiming victimhood is asserting a right to justice. But despite our claim in the Pledge of Allegiance that America offers justice for all, most of us see some people as more deserving of justice than others. And because of our biases — conscious or not — we imagine that the people most likely to be victims, those with the greatest claim for justice, are the people most like us.</p>

<p>And so some of us hear the call to believe women as a call for justice, while others hear it as sanctioning injustice against men. Or some hear Black Lives Matter as denying the importance of other lives, while others hear a cry for equal protection.</p>

<h4>Responding as Christians</h4>

<p>So how are we, as Christians, supposed to navigate victimhood and justice in our current cultural climate? I wish I had a tidy answer for that question. But I would suggest a few principles:</p>

<p>First, we must remember that throughout the entirety of scripture, God is concerned with justice for the socially marginalized. Over and over in the Old Testament, prophets condemn Israel for exploiting and oppressing those with few resources and little power — the poor, the widowed, the foreigner, the orphan. Jesus embraces the marginalized in his ministry, healing and loving them no less than (and sometimes more than) the powerful in society.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that every marginalized person is a victim. But it does mean that, when people on the margins of society call for justice, Christians should pay particular attention to these calls. Especially in a society like ours where Christians often have power and privilege, we should use that to amplify calls for justice from those who may lack power or a voice.</p>

<p>Second, we must be cautious when we present ourselves as victims who desire justice. I want to tread carefully here: I absolutely think that Christian women should press charges against abusers and Christian minorities should report the racism that makes them feel unwelcome. But Jesus also tells us to turn the other cheek, give away our tunic as well as our cloak, walk the extra mile.</p>

<p>We believe that God&rsquo;s justice will come, that Christ will reign on earth as in heaven. And so at times, as we await the arrival of God&rsquo;s perfect justice and mercy, we might need to endure some injustice. This especially applies to those of us who have positions of privilege in society. Sometimes that injustice will simply be in our perception: fairness sometimes feels unfair when we don&rsquo;t get what we want. But sometimes we may have to risk a minor injustice to right a greater one.</p>

<p>We believe that God hears the cries of the wronged and that God&rsquo;s justice will one day arrive, tempered by mercy, but still a justice that rights all wrongs. Right now, we cannot fully reproduce God&rsquo;s justice. But may we be people who work towards justice, who honor the oppressed and the injured by earnestly discerning the nature of true justice, God&rsquo;s justice. May we be willing to hold people — even ourselves — to account as we seek justice.</p>

<p>I understand that many people who have experienced sexual assault or other forms of violence prefer not to call themselves victims, often using the term survivor to emphasize their own agency and not the agency taken from then by their attacker.

<p>The question that floats into my mind: who am I?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a question that&rsquo;s hovered for the last two years, as I decided to leave my job and, eventually, my academic career. Who was I if I wasn&rsquo;t a college professor?</p>

<p>Many things stayed the same: I was — am — still a wife and a mother and a friend and a nerd and a baker and a person who wishes she liked beets but who really just can&rsquo;t eat them.</p>

<p>But losing that big piece, that career piece, was difficult. And then came the guilt: as a Christian, shouldn&rsquo;t I be finding my identity in Christ, not my job or my title?</p>

<p>And really, what in the world does it mean to find my identity in Christ? How does that work?</p>

<p>Slowly, though, over the last year, I&rsquo;ve begun to realize what my identity is in Christ: I am beloved.</p>

<p>I struggle with this, because I&rsquo;d rather find my identity in what I do; what I do is under my control (or at least, I can imagine that it&rsquo;s under my control). Being beloved by God doesn&rsquo;t depend on my achievements; it&rsquo;s constant and steady and unchanging even when everything else around me shifts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, reading Tish Harrison Warren&rsquo;s <em>Liturgy of the Ordinary,</em> I was struck by her words:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jesus is eternally beloved by the Father. His every activity unfurls from his identity as the Beloved. He loved others, healed others, preached, taught, rebuked, and redeemed not in order to gain the Father&rsquo;s approval, but out of his rooted certainty in the Father&rsquo;s love.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want that &ldquo;rooted certainty in the Father&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; I want that to be at the core of who I am. It&rsquo;s hard to let go of the idea that I have to earn that love, but if who I am is a person who earns God&rsquo;s love by succeeding in some form, failure or even reformulation moves from difficult to devastating.</p>

<p>And so I lean into being God&rsquo;s beloved, and allowing my action to flow out of my security in God&rsquo;s love.</p>

<p>Who I am? Beloved daughter of God.</p>]]></description>

<p>Share your toys. Share your blanket. Share your space, your books, your pencils: I have 3 children in elementary school, so I constantly remind people to share.</p>

<p>And why do I fight this battle? Because I want my children to grow up to be generous and not miserly, clinging fearfully and angrily to what is theirs. I want them to give with open hands, to invite others in with open hearts. And if I lay that foundation now, with their family, I hope they will carry that generosity on into adulthood.</p>

<p>Because as adults, the temptation to hoard, to be greedy and avaricious, doesn&rsquo;t fade. And sometimes, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell if we&rsquo;re being greedy or prudent: should I stash extra money in savings, or donate it? Do I need a back-up coat? How much really is enough?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not wrong to have some things we don&rsquo;t share; just as I don&rsquo;t expect my girls to share their precious lovies, we all have things that are not for sharing with everyone.</p>

<p>But as I strive to cultivate generosity in my children, I&rsquo;m pushed to consider where I can also share more — time, money, talent, material things. That urge to selfishly cling to what we want lingers, but it can be overcome by a counter-narrative of plenty and openhandedness rather than scarcity.</p>]]></description>

<p>Have you ever been in a restaurant that uses cutesy or thematic names for their restrooms, and hesitated a moment before choosing the (fingers crossed) correct one?</p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s annoying. And often just a bit sexist.</p>

<p>Apparently, though, these cutesy restroom names are yet more evidence of the essential differences God created between men and women. Brett McCracken asserted in a July essay on The Gospel Coalition website that we instinctively know who goes in the &ldquo;Bread&rdquo; room versus the &ldquo;Meat&rdquo; room, confirming deep-rooted differences between the genders.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right: McCracken thinks we instinctively associate women with bread and men with meat because … I guess because women like carbs and men like protein? Or women bake and men hunt? Because something in the essence of women whispers &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; while &ldquo;meat&rdquo; belongs to the inborn nature of men?</p>

<p>McCracken&rsquo;s whole article is problematic, but instead of addressing it specifically I want to talk about gender essentialism, since McCracken is asserting that the essence of men and women differs — and not merely their biology or their social conditioning.</p>

<p>In its simplest form, gender essentialism is the belief that women and men differ not just in their outward biology but also in their inner beings, their essential natures. Many people affirm some form of gender essentialism, not just complementarians; even some feminists are gender essentialists. The debate about how our biology (which everyone agrees is different) shapes or intersects with our nature is long and complex.</p>

<p>People who hold to gender essentialism may believe that women are more peaceful and men more violent; women more emotional and men more rational; women more verbal and men more computational. While most gender essentialists are more than willing to admit individual variation, they see men and women on the whole as having distinct, inborn qualities that go beyond biology.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a gender essentialist because I am not convinced that, absent social conditioning, men and women have different natures. But we can&rsquo;t fully test these theories, and it&rsquo;s certainly possible to be a gender essentialist without denigrating women (or men).</p>

<p>McCracken&rsquo;s article seems to fall into this category of not particularly thoughtful but also not particularly damaging gender essentialism. I&rsquo;m fairly confident that associating women with bread and men with meat is cultural rather than essential, drawing on stereotypes about the foods men love and women love but shouldn&rsquo;t eat. But his point is that women and men, in their differences, complement one another and together form something greater, something better, than either alone.</p>

<p>And I agree. When God created Adam, God said it was not good for him to be alone, and so God created Eve: another human also created in the image of God, an equal and a co-laborer in the work of the Garden. Dissension between the genders is one of the oldest disruptions in human relationships caused by sin; as God&rsquo;s people living in the already-but-not-yet kingdom, women and men should strive to work in harmony with each other.</p>

<p>The problem with the gender essentialism of complementarianism, though, is that it doesn&rsquo;t stop with two binaries balancing and enhancing one another.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Instead, the qualities often assigned to women by complementarians denigrate them and place them in an eternally subordinate position. Women are more easily deceived. Women are more submissive. Women are less capable of logic. Women are less skilled at leading. Women are nurturers, bound to home and family, while men are providers, able to move freely in the public sphere.</p>

<p>In short, in this view women&rsquo;s natures make them followers and men&rsquo;s natures make them leaders: a state far removed from two equals complementing each other.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for combinations in which the separate parts form a whole greater than any single part; I still dream about the most perfect <a href="http://www.parkerandotis.com/store/catalog/category/view/id/8">turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich</a> I&rsquo;ve ever had. <em>Vive la différence</em> and all that. But when &ldquo;different&rdquo; places one gender above the other, we&rsquo;ve stopped working towards a greater whole. We&rsquo;ve instead made one part the whole, allowing the other part in only when it enhances the first.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re going to rhapsodized about the beauty of complementary combinations in God&rsquo;s creation, we have to create space for the complex dance as different flavors, different people, weave together an amazing new reality. As God&rsquo;s people we are better together, creating harmony rather than dissonance out of our differences — whatever the origin of those differences. This is only possible when we value all the differences equally, not subordinating one and elevating another. And that can only happen when we wholeheartedly affirm that, in their essence, women and men alike reflect the image of their creator.</p>

<p><strong>Complete</strong></p>

<p>Complete is hard for me. I could write pages about incomplete: all the things I could do and haven&rsquo;t, or have started but not finished; my inner critic (the gift — or curse — of being a 1 on the Enneagram) often delights in pointing out how very incomplete I am.</p>

<p>So what does completeness look like? Sometimes completeness looks like finishing, achieving: dinner is complete, or my tasks for the day. But sometimes completeness doesn&rsquo;t come from checking items off a list or having everything arranged just so.</p>

<p>Complete is when my whole family piles on the couch after dinner to watch the Great Brittish Bake Off, even if the dishes aren&rsquo;t done.</p>

<p>Complete is when I get coffee with a friend, catching up on our lives and laughing together.</p>

<p>Complete is when I see friends or family I&rsquo;ve missed, when distance collapses and we gather together around a table.</p>

<p>Complete is when I spend time in prayer, immersing myself in the vastness of God and somehow emerging even more wholly myself than when I started.</p>

<p>Complete comes in these moments of connection and times of worship, when I am reminded that it is not good to be alone.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Crowd.</strong></p>

<p>I normally don&rsquo;t like crowds: the mass of people pressing around me, separating me from my companions, unconsciously bumping me, invading my personal space. I worry about getting lost, being trampled, losing a child.</p>

<p>And yet, sometimes, it&rsquo;s powerful to be part of a crowd. Sitting in an audience at a play, everyone gasping at the same time; marching in a group against injustice; waiting in line for a new book or movie. The excitement and energy of the crowd contagious, flowing over and through me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s obviously the power and danger of crowds: your individual voice swells to become a dozen, a hundred, a million voices strong — or, in the midst of the crowd, your voice disappears, crushed under the roar of other voices.</p>

<p>Let us pray for wisdom to know when to join our voices to the crowd or to stand against it, even if we cannot rise above the crush, so that we may not lose ourselves.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Subversion in Scripture: Rahab</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Part of a recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture</a> in which I highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority, our notions of who is &ldquo;in&rdquo; and who is &ldquo;out.&rdquo; When Jesus became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire in order to conquer a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire, he upended our comfortable notions about how power works. But if we pay attention, we see these subversions of power over and over in scripture.</em></p>

<p>For my first post in this series, I wrote about <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/06/subversion-tamar">Tamar and Judah</a>. Despite the fact that she tricked her father-in-law into getting her pregnant, Tamar is not only called righteous at the time but Matthew also includes her as one of only four women in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar&rsquo;s story reminds us that God cares about the marginalized and seeks justice for the wronged and oppressed, flipping our ideas of power upside down.</p>

<p>The next woman included in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1&amp;version=NIV">Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus,</a> however, doesn&rsquo;t point to the righting of injustices. Instead, this woman — Rahab the prostitute from Jericho — challenges our ideas about who can be a part of God&rsquo;s people, subverting our tribal conceptions of insider and outsider.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+2&amp;version=NIV">Rahab&rsquo;s story</a> is straightforward: she lives in the city of Jericho, and she along with all the inhabitants of that city know that they are the next target of the Israelites — the people who are conquering and settling the land to the west of the Jordan River. When two spies from the Israelite camp enter Jericho, they stay at Rahab&rsquo;s inn. Rahab hides the spies from city authorities and, in return, demands protection for herself and her family when the Israelites invade.</p>

<p>The spies and Rahab make an elaborate series of promises, and both sides <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:15-25&amp;version=NIV">keep their words:</a> Rahab helps the spies escape and hangs the identifying red cord in her window, and when the Israelites attack and defeat the city they not only spare Rahab and her family but then allow Rahab&rsquo;s family to live in the Israelite camp — where, the author of Joshua informs his audience, Rahab lives <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+6:25&amp;version=NIV">&ldquo;to this day.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>From this story, Rahab comes across as savvy and opportunistic: she sees the writing on the wall<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for Jericho and she secures safety for her family. Which is good for her, certainly, and suggests that she thought the Israelites' God was stronger than her own. But she seems more interested in self-preservation than in theology, more motivated by her desire to live than by any encounter with the God of Israel.</p>

<p>In short, Rahab both by virtue of her profession (prostitute) and her opportunism seems an unlikely candidate for inclusion in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And yet there she is, appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy as the mother of Boaz, who himself marries another foreign woman, Ruth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Why might Rahab merit inclusion?</p>

<p>The writer of Hebrews gives us one clue: &ldquo;By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient&rdquo; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11:31&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 11:31</a>. Although the book of Joshua only has Rahab acknowledging the superior military power of the God of the Israelites, the writer of Hebrews credits this as faith in God, faith that God is indeed powerful.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s faith, or belief in the power of God, results in her salvation as Joshua insists that she and her family be spared in the destruction of Jericho and also be allowed to live among the Israelites. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that she isn&rsquo;t an Israelite herself, or that her faith was spurred by her fear of death. She is not only saved from death but saved into the larger community of God&rsquo;s people, ultimately appearing in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>And so Rahab challenges our notions of who gets to be part of God&rsquo;s kingdom. To put it one (fairly Calvinist) way, God does the choosing, not us; from another point of view, God accepts all who come, rewards those who trust.</p>

<p>Rahab and her family are the foreigners, the all-too-often-feared Other. Although scripture records no reaction to the inclusion of Rahab and her family in the Israelite camp, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that some Israelites viewed them with distrust or disgust. She betrayed her people once; would she do it again? She chose a new God, but what old practices did she cling to that might infect others?</p>

<p>But instead of being quarantined off from God&rsquo;s people or treated as a second-class citizen, Rahab is instead lifted up and honored. She points us towards the inclusiveness of God&rsquo;s kingdom, a kingdom that embraces the stranger, that transcends our fallen human impulse to exclude the Other.</p>

<p>Rahab&rsquo;s presence in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy tells us that we must not assume that a person is an outsider to the Church, to God, because they do not fit our idea of what an insider should be. Let us be challenged by Rahab&rsquo;s story and let us work to reflect in our communities and our churches the wonder of people from every tongue and tribe and nation coming together to worship God.</p>

<p>After an unplanned but much-needed two-week hiatus, I&rsquo;m back! As <em>Into Resurrection</em> approaches its first anniversary, I have been reflecting on where I see it going in the future. I don&rsquo;t intend to stop writing here any time soon — but I think it&rsquo;s time to make a few changes.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;ll only be posting a substantial piece once a week, on Tuesdays. On Fridays, I plan to post something short and more off-the-cuff. In addition to these posts, though, I&rsquo;m launching a bi-weekly newsletter! Stay tuned for info on how to subscribe. This newsletter will have a more personal update, links to great articles I&rsquo;ve read or to pieces I&rsquo;ve written, and (inevitably) a book or two to add to your TBR pile.</p>

<p>And what, you ask, will I be doing in all my spare time? Excellent question!</p>

<p>I am now working part-time for my church, as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministry  and as Communications Coordinator. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be on staff because I love my new colleagues and because I&rsquo;m happy to turn my administrative skills to good use.</p>

<p>But the other reason I&rsquo;m excited to be on staff at my church is that I&rsquo;m in the process of exploring a call to pastoral ministry — specifically, the priesthood.</p>

<p>Whew. Saying that out loud is still so strange to me.</p>

<p>When I decided to resign my teaching position 20 months ago, I never could have imagined that pastoral ministry might be in my future. But this seems to be a path that I need to follow for now, and when I&rsquo;m not surprised or terrified I&rsquo;m really excited to see where this will lead.</p>

<p>Also, in between working and writing for this blog and preaching the occasional sermon, I&rsquo;m beginning to write articles for other publications and starting on a book about faith and feminism. As I work out ideas for my book, expect to see more blog content on the place of feminism within Christianity — I have a whole stack of books that I&rsquo;m excited to dive into.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to write about subversion in scripture — Rahab is coming up next month — and about women in Christianity. And in September, I want to jump off from a rather ridiculous Gospel Coalition piece that divided food in to &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in order to think about gender essentialism.</p>

<p>I was in academia for so long that the start of a new school year feels more like a new year than January 1st. So I&rsquo;m excited to go into this new (school) year with a new plan for the blog, a new newsletter, a new job, a new calling. I hope that you&rsquo;ll stick with me as I continuing moving into this new season of my life!</p>]]></description>

            <title>Failure and Power at Willow Creek</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/Willow_Creek_sign.jpg" alt="Willow Creek Community Church sign" />

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about the situation at Willow Creek. I have no special insights, no particular connection beyond gratitude for its prominence as an egalitarian congregation. I was thrilled a year ago when Willow announced that their new lead pastor, the successor to Bill Hybels, <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/october/willow-creek-bill-hybels-names-co-ed-pastors-to-succeed.html">would be a woman.</a></p>

<p>But the slow-moving train wreck at Willow Creek over allegations that Bill Hybels <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-willow-creek-pastor-20171220-story.html#">acted inappropriately</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/bill-hybels-willow-creek-pat-baranowski.html">towards multiple women</a> is a painful reminder that egalitarian theology isn&rsquo;t enough to protect women from men willing to abuse their power.</p>

<p>I would like to think that egalitarian theology automatically creates a better atmosphere for women. Because as much as I grieve for the many women hurt by the actions of leaders in the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to see these abuses as the natural outgrowth of theologies that treat women as subordinate to men. It&rsquo;s much harder when the abuses occur in churches with the &ldquo;right&rdquo; theology.</p>

<p>I do think that complementarian theology creates a culture ripe for abuse. And I believe that egalitarian theology, a theology that maintains the full equality and humanity of men and women, can help protect against the abuse of women.</p>

<p>But the difficult reality revealed by Willow Creek is that no theological system can fully protect women. While complementarian theology can hide abuse under the veneer of biblical faithfulness, egalitarian theology can blind us to abuse because we imagine that this right theological framework automatically translates into the right treatment of women.</p>

<p>As Willow Creek demonstrates, though, someone like Bill Hybels can simultaneously believe that a woman is fully qualified to succeed him in ministry while also, allegedly, treating some women as objects for his own sexual gratification.</p>

<p>In the wake of the resignation of the entire elder board and the lead pastors of Willow Creek last week, <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/08/10/beaty-oped/">Katelyn Beaty argued</a> that the problem is not, at its core, about misogyny or sexual misconduct; instead, the problem is the blindness of the American evangelical church to power.</p>

<p>I agree with Beaty that power is the elephant in the room, and that any way forward for Willow that refuses to address power will fail to prevent similar problems in the future.</p>

<p>The events at Willow Creek should be a sobering reminder for all of us who hold egalitarian theology. If our view of women in the church does not address the power structures — the powers and principalities of the world — that elevate men over women, we end up with an empty theology, pretty words that cannot accomplish their promise of equality for women.</p>

<p>Addressing the power of patriarchy is a far more difficult task than inviting the occasional woman to preach or even hiring women to lead. But unless we are willing to do that hard work, egalitarian theology will never be able to fully liberate women to serve alongside men and freely use their gifts to build up the church. Egalitarian theology will become yet another &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; mask under which women are still treated as less than men.</p>

<p><em>I highly recommend Scot McKnight&rsquo;s blog posts outlining the events at Willow over the last few years that have led up to this scandal,</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/08/06/willow-your-time-is-now/">here</a> <em>and</em> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2018/06/27/about-willow-creek-what-do-i-think/">here.</a></p>]]></description>

            <title>Book Review: Fat and Faithful</title>

<p>My youngest daughter loves my &ldquo;fluffy tummy.&rdquo; Let me see it, Mommy, she begs; lifts up my shirt; buries her head in my belly. You&rsquo;re so soft, she says.</p>

<p>Tell me why it&rsquo;s so fluffy, she asks. She knows the answer: because I grew three big, beautiful babies in my body. But she wants to hear, again, that my belly is tangible proof that she was once a part of me.</p>

<p>She loves my soft, squishy, fluffy tummy so much that I can&rsquo;t bear to tell her my truth:</p>

<p>I hate it.</p>

<p>To me, my belly fat doesn&rsquo;t represent three pregnancies that happened alongside a PhD, a cross-country move, a new job, so many good and hard things in my life. Instead, it represents failure. Lack of discipline and self-control.</p>

<p>My belly betrays that I&rsquo;d rather sleep than pry myself out of bed and hit the gym. It reveals that I think chocolate tastes better than skinny feels. It shows how much I enjoy eating the bread that I love baking.</p>

<p>The jiggle in my thighs proves that I cannot bring my mind to bear over matter. That I have failed to discipline my genetic predisposition to squishiness into lean muscle.</p>

<p>What my daughter sees as physical evidence of love and comfort and connection I see as failure of the will.</p>

<p>And so I found Nicole Morgan&rsquo;s new book, <em>Fat and Faithful,</em> incredibly challenging. In her book, Morgan makes a strong case for recognizing the image of God in <em>every</em> body, regardless of how far that body strays from our cultural ideas of a &ldquo;good&rdquo; body.</p>

<p>From this starting point, Morgan strongly criticizes the Christian diet industry, and indeed our modern-day understanding of the sin of gluttony. She argues that our association of skinniness with holiness is not only cultural but damaging as it devalues the personhood of those who do not, or cannot, achieve a &ldquo;good&rdquo; body.</p>

<p>Although the book is not a memoir, Morgan uses her own experiences as a fat woman in the church to illustrate the heartbreaking pressure and dehumanizing assumptions she faced and, at times, internalized. As a young woman, she believed that her large body negated her words, that no one would come to Christ through her because she lacked the faith and discipline to lose weight.</p>

<p>Morgan is absolutely right that the church, like the rest of the culture, prizes thinness — and she drives home the necessary point that the church does great damage when it equates fatness with sinfulness.</p>

<p>I also appreciate her point that an obsession with how and what we eat — calorie counting, labeling foods &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; berating ourselves for cheating — gets in the way of joyful communal tables. I&rsquo;ve agonized myself over how people might perceive my own food choices at communal meals, and that internal agony does nothing to enhance community.</p>

<p>Morgan makes good and important points about loving and accepting our bodies, and about how the church has failed to honor the image of God in bodies that exist outside cultural ideals of beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>But I still struggle with the idea of fat acceptance, especially for myself. I find myself able to extend grace and acceptance to others that I just can&rsquo;t seem to apply to myself.</p>

<p>I know that I&rsquo;m not as disciplined with my eating and exercising as I could be. I eat far too much sugar and too many carbs. I don&rsquo;t exercise as much as I should. I ended one gym membership when I moved this spring, and I haven&rsquo;t managed to actually sign up at the new gym I&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>

<p>I want to be healthy — that&rsquo;s part of my motivation, and not bad — but I also want to be closer to my pre-pregnancy body. Maybe even my pre-PhD-exams body. I&rsquo;ve never loved my body, but I now regret not loving it more when I was far closer to social ideals.</p>

<p>And after years of living as a woman in America, it&rsquo;s incredibly hard for me to disentangle &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; from &ldquo;thin.&rdquo; I want to bike with my kids. Physical activity lifts my mood. I feel crappy when I eat too much sugar. But when I swap fresh fruit for ice cream and a brisk walk for a Netflix binge and I don&rsquo;t lose weight, I wonder if it&rsquo;s worth the effort. I let my scale tell me whether or not I should feel good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to love this body that I live in. I&rsquo;m not even convinced in my heart of hearts that I should love it, at least not until I manage to remake it into something else, something disciplined, something skinny, something perfect. Something impossible.</p>

<p>So <em>Fat and Faithful</em> challenges me on a personal level. Can I love my body even in its imperfections? Can I love my body enough to care for it rather than punish it into compliance? Can I love my body as God does, as part of God&rsquo;s good creation?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t do it right now. It seems impossible that I will ever love my fluffy tummy the way my daughter does.</p>

<p>But I can start by accepting that she loves it rather than telling her that she should feel differently.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>The final installment in a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Catch up with <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-3">Part 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-4">Part 4.</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>
So you&rsquo;ve read the last several blog posts and decided to add more women to your reading list. Great! There are so very, very many excellent books by women that this blog post could expand to ridiculous proportions. But I will attempt to restrain myself and recommend some books.</p>

<p>I am limiting myself to women who write in English, although this reveals another type of myopia. Plus, this is a <em>very</em> short list of women writers I particularly like or have been particularly challenged by; take these books as recommendations, not a comprehensive education or even introduction to literature by women.</p>

<p><strong>Pre- and Early Modern Writers</strong></p>

<li><p>Sappho, poems: both revered for her skill and vilified for excelling in a male-dominated art, Sappho deserves to be read alongside Homer. I particularly like the translation by Anne Carson titled <a href="https://amzn.to/2mSOTLl"><em>If Not, Winter.</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>Marie de France, <a href="https://amzn.to/2v0E4LA"><em>Lais</em>:</a> short romances, written in the twelfth century, that explore the nature of love and desire.</p></li>
<li><p>Julian of Norwich, <a href="https://amzn.to/2K6rlvx"><em>Revelation of Divine Love</em>:</a> mystical theology that reflects on God&rsquo;s great love for us despite our sinfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Aemilia Lanyer, <a href="https://www.usask.ca/english/phoenix/lanyerpoems1.htm">&ldquo;The Defense of Eve&rdquo;:</a> in this poem, Lanyer makes a strong argument for not blaming Eve alone for the Fall.</p></li>
<li><p>Mary Sidney, <a href="https://amzn.to/2LSixhW"><em>Psalms</em>:</a> Mary completed her brother Philip&rsquo;s English verse translations of the Psalms, and probably edited the ones her brother wrote as well; her translations beautifully render these ancient poems.</p></li>

<p><em>Part 4 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2,</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-3">Part 3.</a></em></p>

<p>On Monday, I offered some reasons why men (and women) should read more books by and about women. But how do you go about doing this, if you&rsquo;re realizing that your Goodreads history is overbalanced towards men?</p>

<p>First, and probably most obviously, find books by women on topics or in genres that you enjoy. Enjoy literary fiction? Check out female nominees and past winners for the <a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2017.html#.W1nezi2ZN_U">National Book Award</a> or the <a href="https://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/news/man-booker-prize-2018-longlist-announced">Man Booker Prize.</a> Enjoy genre fiction? Browse a publisher&rsquo;s catalog or the library shelves for books by women in that genre.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for theology or spiritual writing by women, many websites and publications have reading lists. Try <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2018/june/10-new-or-lesser-known-female-theologians-worth-knowing.html">this one,</a> from <em>Christianity Today,</em> or <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/very-egalitarian-summer-reading-list-12-books-add-your-pile">this one,</a> from Christians for Biblical Equality, or <a href="https://dailytheology.org/2018/03/08/women-theologians-you-should-be-reading-right-now-a-primer/">this one</a> from Daily Theology.</p>

<p>Next, be willing to try new types of books. Give <a href="https://amzn.to/2LRmAro"><em>Pastrix</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2LDJnKy"><em>Still: Notes on a Mid-Faith Crisis</em></a> a chance. Try a family drama — I&rsquo;m fond of Liane Moriarty at the moment, and it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with Jennifer Weiner. These books are by women, about women, and marketed to women, but they capture the human experience and are just fun reads.</p>

<p>Not everyone likes everything; you may decide that a particular genre is not for you. But you may also find a whole new type of book to enjoy.</p>

<p>Once you find books by women that you enjoy, tell people about them! Both my husband and I are in (separate) theology book clubs (yes, we&rsquo;re nerds), and we both work to notice when our reading lists veer too heavily male and to make alternate suggestions. And fortunately, our friends will do the same, which means that we also receive new recommendations.</p>

<p>And, as you are able, purchase books by women. Publishers want to make money, so creating a demand for a certain type of book will encourage publishers to publish and promote women writers.</p>

<p>Finally, especially if you have young children in your life, work to normalize reading about and empathizing with girls for <em>both</em> girls and boys. Shannon Hale has <a href="http://shannonhale.tumblr.com/post/171419839125/were-ready-a-post-for-kidlitwomen">heartbreaking stories</a> about parents, teachers and librarians who steer (or shove) boys away from books about girls. Even though we not only allow but encourage girls to read about boys, the reverse is not true.</p>

<p>So if you have children, or work with children, or are in a position to recommend books to children, don&rsquo;t always give books about trucks and monsters to boys. Give them books like <a href="https://amzn.to/2uSCWJN"><em>The Princess in Black</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2NMnfLj"><em>The Princess and the Pizza</em></a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2uSwbYv"><em>Journey</em></a>, or recommend them. Suggest that boys read about Serena Williams and Ruth Bader Ginsberg (the <em>Who Was …?</em> series is great for elementary schoolers). Don&rsquo;t just give <em>Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls</em> to girls; direct boys to it too.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t need to replace Harry Potter and Holden Caulfield (okay, maybe Holden Caulfield). But we do need to make sure that boys and girls are expected to read about women protagonists, and that boys feel as comfortable identifying with Katniss Everdeen as girls do identifying with Harry Potter.</p>

<p>Changing large cultural attitudes towards women writers will be a long, slow process. Significant cultural pressure leads to the dismissal of women&rsquo;s writing as fluffy, emotional or specific rather than universal, and the problem is only worse within theological and spiritual writing.</p>

<p>But slow as change may be, it starts with deliberate choices to value women&rsquo;s voices and experiences and to reevaluate our assumptions about the values of masculinity, rationality, and objectivity. And that change can start with the simple act of picking up a book by a woman.</p>

<p>Come back on Monday for my list of women writers to get you started!</p>

<p><em>Part 3 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1 here</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-2">Part 2</a> here.</em></p>

<p>In part 1 of this series, I argued that modern American society makes it easy for men to avoid reading books by women — and that this is a problem because it devalues not just women&rsquo;s contributions but women&rsquo;s personhood. And in part 2, I argued that the solution cannot be for women to write like men (whatever that means), because instead of addressing the problem this solution continues to devalue women.</p>

<p>So how can we address these problems? What might make men more likely to read books by and about women? I will have some practical suggestions in Thursday&rsquo;s post, but today I want to focus on <em>why</em> men should read women authors.</p>

<p>In the big picture, as I&rsquo;ve argued, not reading books by women reinforces — intentionally or not — the idea that women are not fully human in the way that men are. But I think many men, like the writer of the <em>Relevant</em> article I discussed in part 1, don&rsquo;t set out to either avoid or devalue women.</p>

<p>They (and women, too) simply swim in cultural waters that make it easy to dismiss books by women, especially spiritual or theological books written by women.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So why should we intentionally seek out books by women? Beyond the big picture of treating women as fully human and fully capable of writing books relevant to men as well as women, I see three reasons to read women.</p>

<p><strong>First, developing empathy:</strong> a growing body of research suggests that reading fiction helps us to develop empathy, sympathetic understanding of the emotions of others. Empathy makes us more kind, less likely to stereotype, better able to understand why a person may make particular choices.</p>

<p>From the very beginnings of their reading lives, girls read about boys and girls, developing empathy for men as well as other women. Far too often, however, boys are directed away from books about girls. Boys can identify with Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, but not Jo Marsh or Katniss Everdeen.</p>

<p>But limiting the characters boys and men encounter also limits the empathy they develop: the empathy extends to characters like them (male), but not to female characters and, by extension, to girls and women.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This problem is intersectional, too — not limited to gender. When we expect everyone to identify with white men, but only women to identify with women or minorities to identify with minorities, we limit empathetic development and reinforce the sexism and racism that sees women and minorities as deviating from the norm.</p>

<p><strong>Second, embracing diversity:</strong> Alongside developing empathy, reading books by and about a wide variety of people develops an appreciation for diverse perspectives and experiences.</p>

<p>No matter how much we know better, we easily slide into the assumption that our perspective and our experiences are normal and right. Interacting with a variety of people helps us overcome this assumption: what seems normal and obvious to us might be completely foreign to another, and we can learn from that new perspective.</p>

<p>We should embrace this sort of diversity in a variety of ways, but reading in particular allows us to deepen our historical perspectives. We have much to learn from writers and characters of the past, beginning with humility.</p>

<p>Like developing empathy, this value extends beyond the question of why we should read books by and about women. But gaining the perspective of women on their lives and experiences will enrich our own understanding of the human condition.</p>

<p><strong>Third, challenging the idea that men are the norm:</strong> When society treats men as the standard of what it means to be human, the male experience is valued above the female experience. And western patriarchy makes men rational and women emotional, men able to transcend the body while women are trapped by their bodies, men capable of an objectivity that women cannot attain.</p>

<p>Reading and valuing women writers is a part of learning to value &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; characteristics. We must learn to value these traits, often gendered as feminine but in reality common to all humans, in order to integrate and value our whole human selves — mental, emotional, physical, spiritual.</p>

<p>To be sure, individual readers and writers will have preferences for the more intellectual or the more confessional, the more objective or the more subjective. But we need to stop imagining that books by men (and this is especially prevalent in theological and spiritual writing) are intellectual and objective and therefore better than confessional and subjective books, which are often written by women.</p>

<p>Theology cannot be merely intellectual; it is also lived. And the intellect is not divorced from context or free of bias; our reason is shaped by our experience, including our experience as a man or a woman. No view of God is purely rational; human beings cannot attain some sort of pure rationality.</p>

<p>Diversifying our reading, and especially our theological reading, helps us to see the limitations of what we consider normative and the flaws in the idea that theology based in experience is inferior to theology based in reason.</p>

<p>Right now, a whole host of women spiritual writers are reminding Christians that we need to pay attention to how our theologies can be lived and embodied in the world. They don&rsquo;t argue that we should toss out all the church fathers, but they do remind us that beautiful intellectual systems can crumble when they meet our embodied lives — and often the flaw is in the theology, not the embodiment.</p>

<p>When we elevate the male and the intellectual as objective and true, we lose the wisdom gained by experience and the insights offered by our emotions. I do not mean to suggest that women are more emotional than intellectual, but in our current western culture women are more free to express their emotions and write based on experience. And instead of devaluing their perspective, we should interrogate our own assumptions about male rationality and objectivity.</p>

<p>To boil this post down to one reason to read more women writers: patriarchy harms not just women, but also men. When men don&rsquo;t read books by and about women, their perspectives are limited, their empathy may be stunted, and they place far too much confidence in their own point of view.</p>

<p><em>Part 2 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women and how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men. Read <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/07/men-reading-women-1">part 1 here.</a></em></p>

<p>In Monday&rsquo;s post, I raised a problem — that men don&rsquo;t read books by women at the same rate as they read books by men — and argued that this problem is a symptom of a larger problem. That problem? Society still does not view women as quite fully human, because women&rsquo;s experiences are assumed to be <em>specific</em> while men&rsquo;s experiences are <em>universal.</em></p>

<p>So how might we begin to address this problem? Setting aside the impossible dream of smashing the patriarchy in one fell swoop, encouraging men to read more books by and about women is a good start. After all, from the time we are young, we women are expected to read books by men and about men, expected to be able to identify with male protagonists. Why not ask the same of men?</p>

<p>One way to get men to read books by women involves obscuring the author&rsquo;s gender. From George Eliot to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree_Jr.">James Tiptree, Jr.</a> to J.K. Rowling, women have used pen names and initials to gain male audiences for their books.</p>

<p>This tactic is harder, though, for writers of non-fiction. In order to publish a book, non-fiction writers need a platform, an audience for their words — and that makes it somewhere between difficult and impossible to obscure gender. So women who write non-fiction cannot easily pass themselves off as men in order to gain male readers.</p>

<p>The next solution that presents itself? Women just need to write more like men. This advice surfaces periodically in a variety of contexts: women should apologize less, use &ldquo;just&rdquo; less, cut out the uptalk and the vocal fry, all in order to be taken more seriously because they sound more like men.</p>

<p>At one panel at this year&rsquo;s Festival of Faith and Writing, one woman writer suggested that in order to get male readers, women need to write more serious theology and leave behind the personal and confessional style so common in women&rsquo;s spiritual writing in particular.</p>

<p>This advice is not entirely bad. I think women do apologize far too often for simply existing in the world. And women who write Christian non-fiction for a general audience do tend towards (or are pushed towards) the personal and confessional even when they write about theology.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem: the advice to write more like a man continues to elevate the male voice as normative. And when that normative male voice is also viewed as objective and logical, the female voice is seen as deviant, subjective and emotional. So in asking women to write more like men, we continue to devalue qualities viewed as &ldquo;feminine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do think that women should be writing more theological books, that women should have and fully use their intellectual grounding to challenge and encourage the church. But if we don&rsquo;t challenge the assumption that women write subjectively and emotionally, and therefore lack authority or relevance to the church as a whole, we have not solved the problem.</p>

<p>Back in the high middle ages, women were barred from the university education that allowed someone to participate in scholastic theology. But women could still hear from God, could still be mystics; for many women (like Julian of Norwich or <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-23-2017-catherine-of-siena">Catherine of Siena</a>), mysticism offered their only entrance into the world of medieval theology, and they took full advantage of that entrance to participate in and even shape wider theological discussions.</p>

<p>Similarly, for many women today the devotional or confessional style — often personal and emotional — is the best route into spiritual and theological writing. As <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore recently revealed,</a> she like many other women was blocked from the avenues to theological education and authority. But unlike the medieval mystic theologies written by women that were widely read, the more personal, devotional and confessional styles of these modern women writers leads to their dismissal as fluffy or relevant only to other women.</p>

<p>We can, and should, not only allow but encourage women to write more &ldquo;like men,&rdquo; if by that we mean that women should be writing solidly intellectual theology, like a James K.A. Smith or a N.T. Wright. Women are no less capable of this work than men, and women&rsquo;s perspectives will help challenge the assumption that male perspectives are, or should be, normative.</p>

<p>But this cannot be the entire solution. We must also recognize the value of the personal and the confessional. After all, Augustine&rsquo;s <em>Confessions</em> is a classic of Christian theology for good reason. Theologies influenced by experience, mediated by more personal and emotional styles of writing, can be just as valuable to the church as intellectual or academic writing.</p>

<p>And so men <em>should</em> read books like Glennon Doyle&rsquo;s <em>Love Warrior</em> and Jen Hatmaker&rsquo;s <em>Seven</em> and Sarah Bessey&rsquo;s <em>Out of Sorts</em> and pretty much anything by Lauren Winner. These women draw on their experiences to offer valuable insights to the whole church, not only to other women.</p>

<p>Women shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide the fact that they are women, either by obscuring their names or jettisoning so-called &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; writing styles. We (both men and women readers) should value their full personhood, including their experience of being a woman in the world, and not see it as a deviation from or poor imitation of the normative experience of men.</p>

<p>And so I resist placing the responsibility on women to attract male readers by contorting themselves into man-like shapes. Instead, men should be willing to read a variety of books by women, from the academic to the confessional. And perhaps in the process, more men can discover the value of personal and experiential theologies and we can work in earnest to dismantle the idea that theology must be intellectual and abstract.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 1 of a five-part series on why men may be reluctant to read women, how even well-intentioned men default to reading other men, and why this is a problem.</em></p>

<p>Several months ago, <em>Relevant</em> magazine posted an article by a male writer about his foray into reading books written by women. After realizing that neither he nor his friends read anything written by women, he decided that he would get recommendations from a helpful employee at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>

<p>He ended up reading Kim Harrison&rsquo;s urban fantasy novel <em>Dead Witch Walking,</em> and after mocking the book/genre, he discovers that he gained a new perspective on life by reading a book with a female protagonist.</p>

<p>My short summary does not do justice to this article, but it was every bit as bad as you&rsquo;re imagining. So bad, in fact, that after concerted pushback the article was taken down within a couple of hours.</p>

<p>But this article, and then a panel at the Festival of Faith and Writing in April on men reading women, keep coming back to me. After eighteen years studying and teaching English in colleges and after a lifetime as a woman, particularly a Christian woman, I have no difficulty believing that men don&rsquo;t read nearly as many books by women as they do by men.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to receive at least a BA in English without reading more than a handful of women writers. I&rsquo;m going to assume that if this is true in English — where the whole point of the major is reading many books by many authors — it&rsquo;s equally true in pretty much every other field.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Because of this state of affairs, I even have some sympathy for the writer of the <em>Relevant</em> article; I doubt that he intentionally avoided books by women simply because women wrote them. And when he became aware of the deficit in his reading, he did begin the process of addressing it.</p>

<p>But his reading experience shows just how pervasive the idea is that books by and about men are for everyone, while books by and about women are for women. Because that&rsquo;s how men end up not reading women: they assume that books by women are not relevant to them or their life experiences.</p>

<p>So much social weight lies behind this assumption. At perhaps the most obvious level, books by women often have clearly feminine covers: flowers, pastels, and flowing scripts visually signal a particular audience. (The author Maureen Johnson, back in 2013, initiated a widespread conversation about gendered book covers that led to <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/07/coverflip-maureen-johnson_n_3231935.html?slideshow=true#gallery/296089/0">these delightful gender-flipped covers</a>).</p>

<p>As an example, I just started reading an advance copy of <em>Fat and Faithful</em> by Nicole Morgan. Morgan writes about bodies and embodiment and incarnation and living as the image of God, topics that apply to men and women. But because a woman wrote this book about bodies, is anyone surprised that the cover is a lovely purple with the title in a fancy cursive script, indicating that it&rsquo;s marketed towards women?</p>

<p>Covers and marketing alone, however, do not make up the entire problem. The problem behind the marketing problem? Ingrained patriarchy leads us to assume that men&rsquo;s experiences and perspectives are universal in a way that women&rsquo;s simply aren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The roots of this assumption run deep in the history of western culture and emerge every time <a href="http://shannonhale.tumblr.com/post/171419839125/were-ready-a-post-for-kidlitwomen">someone tells Shannon Hale</a> that boys don&rsquo;t read books about princesses and every time women&rsquo;s books are presumed to be too fluffy for major literary awards.</p>

<p>Why is this attitude a problem? Does it actually matter whether or not men read books by and about women?</p>

<p>This attitude suggests that women are not quite fully human in the way that men are, not quite capable of speaking to or reflecting the human experience, not able to transcend the specific and achieve universality.</p>

<p>In this view, Harry Potter teaches us about what it means to be human; Rachel Morgan, the protagonist of <em>Dead Witch Walking</em>, teaches us what it means to be a woman — knowledge that may be interesting for men, but not necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, I think it is a problem when men don&rsquo;t read books by women, or when they read books by women expecting to find difference rather than common humanity. They miss out on the rich fullness of the human experience and, at the same time, elevate their own experience into universal truth.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I&rsquo;ll be diving into these problems in greater depth and also offering some suggestions on where to start reading women. Check back on Thursday for a new post on whether part of the solution involves women writing more like men.</p>

<p>I realized that I am currently immersed in narratives about humans with special abilities. I don&rsquo;t know what that says about me right now, or about pop culture: wish fulfillment? Interest in the post-human, the next stage of evolution? The insidious spread of superhero narratives? A bizarre and ultimately meaningless coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Television:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been binge-watching my way through the most recent season of <em>Agents of Shield,</em> now available on Netflix. I&rsquo;m a fan of the show, especially of the relationships that have developed amongst the characters, although I can tell that the writers are struggling at times to tell a compelling story that stays within the boundaries of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) without actually intersecting with the films.</p>

<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s Phil Coulson and his team just time traveling to the future, as one does, foiling Hydra, as one does, and averting the literal tearing apart of the earth, as one does — while the Avengers are off battling Thanos. It&rsquo;s a little bit much, you know?</p>

<p>But as always in the show, the best part lies in the very human struggles to find a place and to learn how to use abilities, inhuman or not, when life takes unexpected turns. Plus, I&rsquo;m crossing all my fingers that Fitz and Simmons just might be the first happy and successful romance in a Whedon-run show.</p>

<p><strong>Comics:</strong></p>

<p>My second pop culture narratives of supernatural abilities come from Marvel as well. After watching <em>Runaways</em> on Hulu, I&rsquo;ve started reading the comics, starting with Brian Vaughn&rsquo;s run in the early 2000s. (Side note: you should definitely read his independent series, <a href="https://amzn.to/2zchRP5"><em>Saga</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2MMQzRi"><em>Paper Girls.</em></a> Really, go find them now.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve quite enjoyed the comics. They differ some from the Hulu show, as I expected, and the differences have kept the story fresh even as it overlaps with what I watched. But I&rsquo;m definitely a sucker for a coming-of-age series about a bunch of young people with emerging powers and complicated parental relationships. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying Brian Vaughn&rsquo;s writing, and I&rsquo;m very excited to work my way up to Rainbow Rowell&rsquo;s run as writer of <em>Runaways.</em></p>

<p>(And another side note: I ❤️❤️❤️ Rainbow Rowell <em>soooo</em> much, and <em>squee</em> she&rsquo;s writing another Baz and Simon book! If you have never read her novels, there&rsquo;s still plenty of summer left to read at least <a href="https://amzn.to/2tW52Dz"><em>Fangirl</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2ML0Xcn"><em>Carry On.</em></a> Do it. Do it now.)</p>

<p><strong>Novels:</strong></p>

<p>Moving away from Marvel, I just finished V.E. Schwab&rsquo;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2zdDIWk"><em>Vicious.</em></a> The ExtraOrdinary humans in this novel (the EOs) gain their powers from near-death experiences, which raises the question of whether those who come back with super-human abilities are still, in fact, human. Schwab doesn&rsquo;t answer the question, but each EO in the novel provides a different angle on the question of whether these gifted individuals are more, or less, than human.</p>

<p>Fair warning: it&rsquo;s a dark novel. Whether &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; refers to EOs, regular humans, or particular individuals remains an open question, but the novel offers plenty of viciousness in a variety of forms. But throughout the viciousness winds a tiny thread of hope that second chances are possible, which is what hooked me in the narrative more than anything else.</p>

<p>The sequel, <em>Vengeful</em>, comes out in September, and I will definitely be reading it.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasts:</strong></p>

<p>To round out my theme of supernatural abilities, I&rsquo;m very much enjoying <a href="http://www.thebrightsessions.com"><em>The Bright Sessions.</em></a> (It&rsquo;s four-season run has just concluded, but I&rsquo;m only about halfway through.) It&rsquo;s about a therapist for &ldquo;atypicals&rdquo; — people with special abilities, like telepathy and dream walking — and the government agency that, er, helps them. (&ldquo;Helps&rdquo; them.)</p>

<p>The unfolding relationships between Dr. Bright and her patients forms the heart of the show, especially as Dr. Bright becomes more human, revealing more about herself. The show also manages to balance big stories about shadowy government agencies and ethically-compromised experiments with smaller stories about teenage romance and the quiet growth of confidence. This is what makes the show extraordinary (see what I did there?): not the special abilities or even the unfolding secrets, but the very human stories that anchor us in this alternate version of our world.</p>

<p>On a practical note, I also love that the episodes are relatively short. I can fit a whole episode in when I drive to and from the grocery store, for example, which is convenient.</p>

<p>Plus which, if podcasts aren&rsquo;t your thing, the writer of the show has signed on with Tor Teen to publish three YA novels based on the show; the first is scheduled to release next year. I&rsquo;m exited that I&rsquo;ll get a chance to return to this universe even when I run out of podcast episodes — and I&rsquo;m really interested to read a book when I already have the voices of the characters so firmly in my head.</p>

<p><strong>Post-human:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why the stars in my entertainment life have aligned on the theme of supernatural / superhuman abilities. Thanks in large part to Marvel, we&rsquo;re having a superhero moment in pop culture: their films and television shows range from solid to excellent, and their strategy of recruiting writers like Rainbow Rowell, Roxane Gay and Ta-Nehisi Coates for the comics means that people like me who don&rsquo;t really follow comics are more inclined to read them.</p>

<p>But Marvel isn&rsquo;t just creating the moment; they&rsquo;re also tapping into our hopes and fears about technology and medicine and the future of humanity. As V.E. Schwab wonders in <em>Vicious</em>, at what point do we begin to lose our humanity? And as we see in <em>The Bright Sessions</em>, how do people cope with being different? How do they cope when others want to take advantage of their special abilities?</p>

<p>And as <em>Agents of Shield</em> asks, what are we willing to sacrifice to gain power? To protect others from our own power? How far will we go to stop the power of others?</p>

<p>Thinking about these questions through the lens of super-powered characters provides plenty of entertainment. But the questions behind the narratives are real questions that speak to some of the dreams and nightmares generated by the technological advances of the modern world.</p>

<p>I like celebrating the 4th of July.</p>

<p>Sign me up for burgers on the grill and crimson watermelon, for cold beer and hot dogs. I love the fireworks especially: the anticipation as dusk begins, the showers of light and color, the walk back home with sleepy children smelling of bug spray and sticky from popsicles.</p>

<p>I enjoy the communal nature of the holiday, jostling for the best view of the Girl Scouts in the local parade and sitting with friends and neighbors at the park.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to celebrate the founding of our nation, to remember the imperfect but passionate men who risked so much on a form of government never before seen in the western world on such a scale.</p>

<p>Despite our flaws as a nation — and there are so many, from slavery and the Trail of Tears to police brutality and separating immigrant children from their parents — I think it&rsquo;s worth celebrating our founding. The founding fathers imagined a new type of government, a new type of relationship between the people and their rulers, and their vision has proven to be remarkably durable.</p>

<p>Their conviction led them to take democracy from a footnote in Greek history roundly critiqued by both Plato and Aristotle to a viable form of government. And I&rsquo;m grateful to live in a country where I have a voice in my government and in its laws.</p>

<p>But despite all the above, I believe it&rsquo;s worth taking a moment to remind ourselves that if we call ourselves Christians, America is not our home.</p>

<p>We can appreciate our nation and participate in our democracy. We can vote and protest and run for office; we should care deeply about what happens in our country. The ability to have a say in government is a privilege that I don&rsquo;t believe Christians should ignore or reject, even when Christians disagree about what to say and how to say it.</p>

<p>Yet we must always remember that the United States is not the kingdom of God. Our government is not our savior. Our loyalty is not to country but to God. Our hope is not in a political party but in Christ.</p>

<p>Sometimes, our work towards and within the already-but-not-yet kingdom of God aligns with our goals and values as citizens of the United States. When we as a nation work towards justice, towards caring for the marginalized, towards helping those in need, we also work towards the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>But other times, our national goals and interests conflict with our loyalties to the kingdom of God. These moments can be difficult to discern, but we must be vigilant and ready to oppose policies that are unjust, cause harm, or dehumanize others.</p>

<p>And whether the work of the kingdom aligns with national interests or not, we must always be wary lest patriotism become idolatry. We live in the world and it is good to care for that world, to seek forms of government that lead to human flourishing. Flawed though they were, the founding fathers sought to do this when they rebelled against their British rulers.</p>

<p>Yet we must also be willing to hold our political institutions loosely, to remember that we can pledge only secondary allegiance to our nation.</p>

<p>No matter how good our government is, it is not God&rsquo;s rule on earth. No matter how much we appreciate our government and our history, we must not allow that to stand in for our faith in God.</p>

<p>And when we have less faith in our rulers, when we see evidence that those in power seek only power and not the well-being of others, we need not be surprised. Our vantage as citizens of heaven allows — even requires — us to name and resist the evils and injustices committed by our rulers.</p>

<p>So as we Americans watch fireworks blossom in the sky and eat potato salad with our neighbors, let those of us who are Christians remember that we are first of all God&rsquo;s people, and only secondarily Americans.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Thing with Feathers</title>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is the thing with feathers - </em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>That perches in the soul -</em></strong></p>

<p>I have a confession: I don&rsquo;t particularly like Emily Dickinson.</p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re wondering know how a real faculty in a real English department at a real university could have given me a PhD given such a personal failure. Life is full of strange surprises.</p>

<p>But this poem? This one about hope? These words that everyone knows? This one gets to me.</p>

<p><strong><em>And sings the tune without the words -</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>And never stops - at all -</em></strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a glass-half-empty type of person. I catastrophize. I imagine the worst-case scenario, hopped up on the adrenaline of anxiety far too late into the night. I wait for the other shoe to drop, for the worst to just happen already.</p>

<p>Is it possible that I have hope perching in my soul? Is it possible that hope sings beneath the buzz of worry and fear?</p>

<p><strong><em>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -</em></strong></p>

<p>I know the storm manufactured by anxiety. I have spent some time weathering the gales of pain and disillusionment and suffering. I don&rsquo;t hear much when the storm is breaking over me. Perhaps I need to tune my ears to the quiet song of hope rather than the roar of the wind.</p>

<p><strong><em>And sore must be the storm -</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>That could abash the little Bird</em></strong></p>

<p>But if I can tune my ears to the quiet song rather than the raging storm, I might find that the song always continues. If I cannot hear it, perhaps I am not listening closely enough, carefully enough: the storm cannot end the song.</p>

<p>The song waits beneath the horror, beneath the pain and the suffering and the anxiety. Surely Pandora was overwhelmed by what flew out of the box, but she learned that the song of hope was there with the evils of the world all along.</p>

<p>We are all Pandora.</p>

<p><strong><em>That kept so many warm -</em></strong></p>

<p>When the storm rages, I crave soft blankets and hot drinks. I yearn for a warm body pressed against mine. A fire on the grate, the hot sun on my face: the song and the warmth twine together, amplify each other.</p>

<p><strong><em>I’ve heard it in the chillest land -</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>And on the strangest Sea -</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>Yet - never - in Extremity,</em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>It asked a crumb - of me.</em></strong></p>

<p>Hope waits for us to find it, to hear it. Hope never chides us for despair, but buoys us up against the waves and the winds. Hope catches us as we begin to fall, leads us out of darkness, reminds us that it was waiting for us all along.</p>

<p>Hope alights in our soul, and then invites us to fly upwards with it. Hope persuades us to hear the song, not the storm. Hope warms us when all around us is damp and dark and cold.</p>

<p>Some days, hope is hard to find. Its song is quiet. It lies buried under fear and anxiety, under evils both all-too-real and only imagined. But it is not gone. It waits for us to find it, it waits to warm our souls, it waits to remind us that life and happiness and goodness exist beyond the storm.</p>

<p>We need only listen for hope&rsquo;s rustling feathers and quiet song.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Women in Christianity: Pandita Ramabai</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>Born in 1858 to a devout, high-caste Hindu family in India, Pandita Ramabai spent her life defying cultural norms and working to better the lives of women in India. Ramabai&rsquo;s father, going against tradition, believed that women ought to be fully educated; despite falling into poverty when Ramabai was young, he gave her a strong intellectual foundation and a thorough grounding in Hindu theology.</p>

<p>Ramabai&rsquo;s parents died when she was only sixteen, but she continued her education and, at the age of twenty, she was invited to speak at Calcutta University. Impressed by her knowledge, the faculty gave her the title &ldquo;Pandita&rdquo; in recognition of her scholarship; she was the first woman to earn this title.</p>

<p>Continuing her defiance of social norms, in 1880 Pandita Ramabai married a man from a lower caste and a different region of India. Because of these social differences, such marriages had been illegal just a decade earlier. Ramabai and her husband seem to have been happy and they had a baby girl, but less than two years after their marriage her husband died, leaving her a widow.</p>

<p>In Indian society at the time, widows — and especially high-caste widows like Ramabai — were expected to seclude themselves, retreating from interactions beyond their families. However, marriage hadn&rsquo;t made Ramabai any more likely to follow social norms; after her husband&rsquo;s death, she spent some time continuing the social activism that the couple had become involved in, then in 1883 she left India to pursue a medical education in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In England, Ramabai spent significant time exploring Christianity and eventually converted. She had been introduced to Christianity during her brief marriage; disillusioned with Hinduism after the death of her parents and because of her growing awareness of social ills, Christianity held appeal for her as a religion that had at its heart a concern for the downtrodden. She wrote of her conversion process, &ldquo;I realized after reading the fourth chapter of St. John’s Gospel, that Christ was truly the Divine Saviour he claimed to be, and no one but He could transform and uplift the downtrodden women of India. … Thus my heart was drawn to the religion of Christ.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Drawing upon her experiences as an Indian woman and inspired by her faith, while in England Ramabai wrote a book in English titled <em>The High Caste Hindu Woman.</em> This book describes the painful realities of Hindu women&rsquo;s lives, including child marriage, the isolation of widows, and the practice of <em>sati</em> — the ritual immolation of a woman on her husband&rsquo;s funeral pyre.</p>

<p>Discouraged, however, by the difficulty of obtaining a medical education in England, Ramabai left for the United States, where she watched Anandibai Joshee graduate from the Women’s Medical College in Philadelphia as the first Indian woman to earn a medical degree. While in the United States, Ramabai published the book she had written in England; <em>The High Caste Hindu Woman</em> became popular, and Ramabai received a warm welcome in the United States. She spent the next few years traveling, speaking and studying across the continent.</p>

<p>As she traveled, she also raised funds for her dream project: a school for Indian women. She studied with educational and social reformers in America, developing plans that she could take back to India.</p>

<p>In 1889, back in India, Ramabai opened a school for Hindu widows called Sharada Sadan. At this school, widows were given an education, but Ramabai experienced resistance from both Hindus and Christians because she included Christian texts in her curriculum, but also used Hindu texts and did not require conversion. When her students began converting, however, Ramabai lost much community support for her educational project.</p>

<p>She was not deterred, however. When a famine hit her region of India in the mid-1890s, Ramabai began taking in many widows, orphans and victims of famine. She purchased land and founded a residential community called Mukti, which still exists today as a refuge for needy women.</p>

<p>Despite the pressures of running Sharada Sadan and Mukti, Ramabai became convinced that she needed to translate the bible into the regional vernacular, Marathi. She spent the last twelve years of her life on this translation, certain that this was a necessary ingredient in the transformation and empowerment of Indian women. Her legacy of her schools, her residential community, and her bible translation should impress us even today.</p>

<p>However, I had never heard of Pandita Ramabai until recently; I&rsquo;m guessing that most of my readers are likewise unfamiliar with her. But her dedication to bettering the lives of women, and crucial role her Christianity played in that dedication, deserve wider recognition.</p>

<p>Ramabai began her activism for women before she became a Christian. And her conversion further fueled her activism, especially as she studied how Jesus interacted with women.</p>

<p>Additionally, her willingness to be counter-cultural extended to her faith. She saw no reason to give up Hindu culture entirely, preferring instead to develop a distinctly India theology. She also viewed church rituals with skepticism and the multitude of protestant denominations with dismay, focusing instead on scripture and on the ecumenism that was fast becoming a hallmark of Indian Christianity.</p>

<p>Ramabai&rsquo;s willingness to defy culture and her desire to find the heart of the gospel led her to the creation of radically inclusive communities, dedicated to the welfare and uplifting of the lowest in Indian society and the creation of a community defined by its unity in diversity.</p>

<p>Although Ramabai has largely been forgotten, we have much to learn from her legacy: her passion for education, her dedication to social activism and her work to improve the lives of women should continue to inspire Christians and feminists alike.</p>

            <title>Still Evangelical?</title>

<p>This could be a very short blog post: my answer to the question of whether I am still an evangelical is that I&rsquo;m really not sure. Probably not. But maybe.</p>

<p>I started drifting from evangelicalism so gradually that I hardly noticed at first. I grew up evangelical and I attended college at the evangelical Harvard (aka Wheaton College), but at Wheaton I began to understand that &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; are not synonyms.</p>

<p>I became Anglican, and while some Anglicans consider themselves evangelical, others don&rsquo;t — to be Anglican need not mean being evangelical.</p>

<p>And I started graduate school at a highly-ranked state university. I had already begun to sour on the culture war mentality that permeates much of evangelicalism, and as I lived and developed relationships outside the evangelical bubble I became completely disenchanted with the &ldquo;us against the world&rdquo; mentality of the evangelical culture wars.</p>

<p>To me, evangelicalism had become too tightly linked to conservative politics and to doctrines I no longer held, like complementarianism and creationism. Plus, I never felt particularly connected to evangelicalism, probably due to my uneasiness from a young age about conversionism. And so I simply let &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; slip from my Christian identity — I had no reason to renounce it, but no reason to embrace it either.</p>

<p>And then 2016 happened.</p>

<p>I was angry at evangelicals. What happened to the values I had been taught growing up? How could the same people who (rightly) deplored Bill Clinton&rsquo;s behavior turn around and justify similar, and worse, behavior by Trump? How could compassionate conservatism turn into dehumanizing rhetoric against people of color?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> How could evangelicals sell their souls for political gain?</p>

<p>But I was also, for the first time, a tiny bit hopeful for evangelicalism. A handful of prominent evangelicals vocally criticized Trump. They pointed out the hypocrisy of supporting Trump. They urged their fellow evangelicals not to support someone who bragged about assaulting women, who displayed breathtaking arrogance even about matters of faith, who lied continually.</p>

<p>Their words were clearly too little, too late; the soul of evangelicalism had become corrupted long before the 2016 election. But for the first time, I saw evangelical leaders waking up to the problems inherent in linking doctrine and political power.</p>

<p>I had no desire to identify as evangelical, though. I felt as if I was watching an old friend I had fallen out of touch with begin to grow a conscience — a good development, but no longer one that affected me.</p>

<p>And then, in April, I attended a panel at the Festival of Faith and Writing with essayists from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830845372/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=intoresurrect-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0830845372&amp;linkId=942f105619cef033b5048ad7404a2d6d">Still Evanglical.</a> The four women on the panel — Kathy Khang, Karen Swallow Prior, Deidra Riggs, and Sandra Maria Van Opstal — were heartbreakingly honest about the challenges of remaining evangelical. Three of these women are women of color, whose challenges as members of evangelical churches are even greater. All of them see themselves as prophetic voices calling evangelicals back to Jesus, back to love, away from the seductive call of political power and nationalism.</p>

<p>Part of me — if I&rsquo;m honest, a large part — wants to wash my hands of evangelicalism. Evangelicals have made their bed, so to speak; let them reap the consequences of their actions. Let them fade into political irrelevance, let them be excoriated by the press, let them suffer for the hypocrisy that allows them to proclaim that families matter and then justify family separation as a deterrent for immigration, that allows them to fight against abortion and turn around to shame women in their churches who are unmarried and pregnant, that allows them to be incredibly sensitive about the smallest slight against themselves while ignoring the oppression of so many in America.</p>

<p>But those feelings are not particularly charitable. Much as I would like to dismiss evangelicals as power-hungry hypocrites, I know too many who are not. I do believe evangelicalism as a whole have lost its way, emphasizing moralism at the expense of love and never examining the painful racism and sexism embedded in the church.</p>

<p>But if they have lost their way, they can find it again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s my job to help evangelicals find their way. I&rsquo;ve been on the edges for so long that I&rsquo;m comfortable here, learning alongside others who love Jesus and respect the bible but who find that evangelicalism doesn&rsquo;t help us do either well. I&rsquo;m probably not still evangelical.</p>

<p>But I honor and admire the work of those who call evangelicals to repentance, to those who speak prophetically even when their audience responds with hostility. I pray for the healing of the evangelical church so that it can once again be light and salt, known for being Jesus in the world.</p>

            <title>Loving the Least of These</title>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I finished this piece on Wednesday, June 20 — just before Trump signed an executive order halting family separations. I hope this order is a reaction to many voices raised in outrage, but I have little trust in this administration. I believe that immigrants and asylum-seekers will continue to be oppressed in other, often more subtle ways. Also, as of today, there is no plan for reuniting separated children and families. We must remain committed to seeing the least of these as Christ sees them, not as our government sees them.</em></p>

<p>I always think that the scariest passage in scripture is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:34-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 28:34-46.</a> It&rsquo;s worth quoting in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote><p>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</p>

<p>“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</p>

<p>“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p>

<p>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’</p>

<p>“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’</p>

<p>“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</p>

<p>“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Protestants have long held that faith alone brings salvation; we do not need to work to earn our salvation. What the reformers meant by <em>sola fide</em> is that only the work of Christ can accomplish salvation; no human effort can reconcile us to God. But despite this basic reality acknowledged by all orthodox Christians, over and over again scripture reminds us that our actions matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:20&amp;version=NIV">James</a> tells us that faith without works is useless. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:12&amp;version=NIV">Paul</a> tells us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Throughout scripture, faith and obedience, faith and action, go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>So we should not be surprised when Jesus declares that those who ignored the least of these — the poor, the outcast, the marginalized, the ill, the uneducated, the unloved and unlovely, the oppressed — have ignored him.</p>

<p>If our faith does not lead us to compassionate action, what good is that faith? That faith becomes a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">clanging cymbal</a>, a faith devoid of love and empathy, a faith that annoys and provokes without contributing anything valuable to those who hear it.</p>

<p>If our love for Jesus doesn&rsquo;t move us to care for the least of these, do we really know Jesus at all?</p>

<hr />

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a hypothetical discussion, of course. The situation on the border as children are pulled away from their parents demands that we respond. We cannot afford to be numb or callous, even when the government or pundits ask us to shrug our shoulders at the suffering inflicted on whole families.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and someone uses the bible to defend that suffering.</p>

<p>Jesus is crammed into a building with hundreds of others, and someone says it is basically summer camp.</p>

<p>Jesus is separated from his family, but someone says he&rsquo;ll be fine in foster care or whatever.</p>

<p>Jesus is pulled from his mother&rsquo;s breast, but someone says it is necessary for national security.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and our government wants us to ignore that suffering. They want us to see his suffering as not real suffering, or as deserved suffering, or as someone else&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>But as Christians, our ultimate loyalty isn&rsquo;t to our government. It&rsquo;s to the kingdom of God. Paul may tell us to obey the governing authorities, but he does not tell us to trust in them. We must see people as Jesus sees them, not as the ruling powers and authorities see them.</p>

<p>We must see Jesus <em>in</em> people, particularly in the people those in power want us to fear. For what do we gain by dehumanizing others in order to gain favor from those in power? What good comes from selling our souls to power, to nationalism, to a pragmatic <em>quid pro quo</em>?</p>

<p>Will we sell our souls for the illusion of safety, for the supposed good of our nation? Will we accept the trauma of another as the cost of our own comfort? Will we place nationalist values above the values of the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p>Or will we refuse to be complicit with the powers of this world? Will we refuse to  remain silent as those in power inflict cruel suffering on the least of these, on people who bear the image of God, on people with whom Jesus identifies?</p>

<p>We must take a stand. We must pray, and donate, and make phone calls; we must march and write and vote and refuse to accept the dehumanization and oppression of these beloved children of God.</p>

<p>This is a moment when we can remind the world that faith is not a clanging cymbal but a motivation to defend the defenseless, to help the helpless, to show love to others no matter what they look like or where they came from.</p>

<p>And more than showing the world, we serve Jesus as we work for the good of the least of these. Let us not be found empty-handed and cold-hearted when we see Jesus before us, hungry, thirsty and imprisoned.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Fathers Day and the Fatherhood of God</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>Father&rsquo;s Day rarely carries the emotional weight of Mother&rsquo;s Day. The whole tone of the holiday is different, lighter: fathers get ties and grilling utensils, not hand-drawn cards and crafts make with handprints. Father&rsquo;s Day cards are likely to be jokey, or at least less sentimental than Mother&rsquo;s Day cards. Breakfast in bed, with the family curled up together, is for mothers; backyard grilling is for fathers.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have seen a upwelling of sensitivity around the emotional landmines of Mother&rsquo;s Day. People write articles and Facebook posts reminding others to be sensitive to those who want to be mothers but aren&rsquo;t, who have difficult relationships with their own mothers or children, who have lost mothers or children.</p>

<p>I saw one such Facebook post about fathers this weekend.</p>

<p>This situation shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. Modern American culture still doesn&rsquo;t have much room for men&rsquo;s emotions, particularly the emotions around tenderness and nurturing that we associate with mothers. It seems to me that there has been some cultural improvement in this direction, but our <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">societal notions of masculinity</a> still have little room for men&rsquo;s emotions beyond anger.</p>

<p>To be clear, I know many men with tender hearts, men who are nurturing fathers who freely show their emotional selves to their children and to others. But cultural ideas about masculinity make it difficult for many men, for many fathers, to express their full emotional selves.</p>

<p>These notions about manhood damage men, pushing them to repress and deny the full range of human emotions. But these ideas about masculinity can also interfere with our conception of God, especially God the Father.</p>

<p>When we think of God the Father through the lens of our cultural definition of manhood, and even fatherhood, it becomes easy to imagine God as distant, unavailable, even angry and easily provoked. But when we do this, we risk missing the tender and nurturing care integral to God&rsquo;s fatherhood.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite image of God as nurturing father comes from the book of Hosea. God says to Hosea, “It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them” (Hos. 11:3-4, NIV).</p>

<p>These images of God helping a toddler walk and feeding a young child remind us that God’s fatherly love is full of tenderness and patience. God nurtures by feeding a toddler, helping that toddler walk — doing for the child what they cannot do for themselves. And I love that image of God lifting a child to his cheek: this shows a moment of care and connection, a moment when that child feels safe, secure, and the center of a father&rsquo;s undivided attention.</p>

<p>This image of God as father shows a father who is present, patient, encouraging, tender — not distant. In the context of Hosea, God is angry and disappointed at how far his children have strayed. But even in that anger God reminds his people that he has loved them and still loves them, that he still wants to nurture them if they will allow themselves to be nurtured.</p>

<p>God frequently uses parenthood as a metaphor for God&rsquo;s love and care for us, and so our own conceptions of fatherhood and motherhood matter for our ideas about God. Let us remember that God shows us tenderness and nurturing care, and let us free men from cultural ideas of masculinity so that they can fully embrace and show their ability to be tender nurturers.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this idea of fatherhood as distant is responsible for the incredibly problematic idea of God punishing his son instead of us. This idea fits with cultural conceptions of masculinity and fatherhood, but misses the reality of the Trinity: God isn&rsquo;t punishing Jesus; rather, God is taking on God&rsquo;s own pain and disappointment in order to restore the relationship between God and humanity.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <title>Subversion in Scripture: Tamar and Judah</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/Rembrandts_school_Tamar.jpg" alt="School of Rembrandt Judah and Tamar" />

</figure></p>

<p>Back at the end of March, I launched a new recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture.</a> In this series, I want to highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority. The incarnation and then then death of Jesus exemplify this subversion best: the creator of the universe became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire. But through his life and death, Jesus conquered a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire and, in so doing, upended our comfortable notions about how power works.</p>

<p>And yet, in America in 2018 we Christians are often far too ready to place our trust in power, our hope in influence, our confidence in our political stances and leaders. It&rsquo;s easy to point fingers at the 81% of evangelicals who supported Trump, and I certainly think that this part of the evangelical church needs to reexamine its relationship to nationalism and politics.</p>

<p>But those of use who aren&rsquo;t evangelical, or aren&rsquo;t sure if we&rsquo;re still evangelical, or who are evangelical but not Christian nationalists, still need the reminder that the first shall be last, that a little child shall lead them, that the foolishness of Christ humbles the wise.</p>

<p>I need the reminder that God is at work in and through the seemingly weak and marginalized, that I will find Jesus where I least expect, that God does not need our achievements or our perfection.</p>

<p>And I also need the reminder that God is a God of justice who will right the wrongs done by the powerful to the weak.</p>

<p>We find this God who does justice and humbles the powerful in the story of Tamar and Judah. This story, told in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+38&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 38,</a> is one of the many odd Old Testament stories, narratives that leave us slightly puzzled about why they were included. In the narrative, Tamar marries one of Judah&rsquo;s son — Judah, who is the eldest son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Judah&rsquo;s son, Tamar&rsquo;s first husband, dies; Tamar then becomes the wife of Judah&rsquo;s second son, Onan. This second son, however, refuses to father a child with Tamar since that child would be considered his brother&rsquo;s rather than his.</p>

<p>God sees this refusal as wicked, so Onan also dies. At this point, Judah&rsquo;s third son is too young to take a wife, so Tamar lives in Judah&rsquo;s house as a widow in the expectation that she will be given a third husband.</p>

<p>A brief history break here: in the patriarchal culture of the Old Testament, women had few individual rights and thus needed men to care for them. A father, then a husband, then a son: without this progression of men in her life, a woman risked poverty and worse. Without a son, Tamar&rsquo;s future is bleak and even her present is tenuous, since she depends entirely on the good will of her father-in-law Judah.</p>

<p>And so, when Tamar sees that Judah&rsquo;s third son is old enough to marry and Judah has made no move to marry the two of them, an inaction that prevents Tamar from having a son, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. Disguised as a shrine prostitute, she sleeps with Judah himself and becomes pregnant, keeping Judah&rsquo;s seal as payment — although Judah does not know who she is.</p>

<p>When Judah hears that Tamar is pregnant, he furiously orders her execution. But confronted with the evidence that Tamar&rsquo;s child is his, Judah reverses his judgment and declares that Tamar &ldquo;is more righteous than I, since I wouldn&rsquo;t give her to my son Shelah&rdquo; (Gen. 38:26, NIV).</p>

<p>That &ldquo;more righteous than I&rdquo; should give us pause. Typically, disguising oneself as a prostitute in order to get pregnant by ones' father-in-law is frowned upon, both now and centuries ago. And yet Judah not only acknowledges her cleverness in securing a child for herself, he declares that her decision to take this action is <em>righteous.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s righteous because, despite her low status as a childless widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s household, Tamar takes steps to address the injustice Judah has committed by denying her a husband and thus a son. Judah recognizes that Tamar has corrected his wrong, and he praises her for doing so.</p>

<p>Moreover, God blesses Tamar&rsquo;s subversive action. She gives birth to not only one son, but two. And in another scriptural oddity, as Tamar gives birth one twin sticks his hand out first and is designated the firstborn — but then he withdraws his hand and his brother is actually born first. I don&rsquo;t envy Tamar&rsquo;s labor, but she ends up with essentially <em>two</em> first-born sons: a doubled blessing from God and doubled promise of a secure future.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Tamar&rsquo;s story is fascinating for its glimpse into ancient customs and the status of women — a status that led Tamar to take a dangerous risk as she sought justice for herself. She&rsquo;s a woman from scripture whose bravery and determination are worth hearing more about.</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>In Matthew&rsquo;s gospel, Matthew names four women in his genealogy of Jesus. The first of these women? Tamar (Matt. 1:3).</p>

<p>Yes, Tamar makes it into the genealogy of Jesus by tricking her father-in-law into sleeping with her. Which is not to say that she is somehow more sinful than the men in the genealogy: the line from Abraham to Jesus is full of men whose actions are far from ideal. But with only four women listed to the forty men — and listed alongside, not in place of, the fathers and sons — we must ask why Tamar makes Matthew&rsquo;s list.</p>

<p>From the Genesis account, what we learn about Tamar is that she holds a powerful man accountable for the injustice that he has done to her. Her methods may be unorthodox, but Judah himself cannot fault them: she was driven to such drastic action by his own failure and inaction, as he himself recognizes.</p>

<p>Judah recognizes Tamar&rsquo;s righteousness; God blesses her with two sons; the writers and editors of Genesis include her story as an integral episode in the lives of Israel&rsquo;s patriarchs; and finally, Matthew lists her in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>Tamar is a woman who rights the wrong done to her, who stands up for justice when no one else will. In so doing she humbles the powerful Judah — and earns his respect. She is one of the least of these, living on the margins of her household as a widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s house. But scripture shows us through the birth of her sons and through her inclusion in both Genesis and Matthew that God was on her side, on the side of the weak and the powerless.</p>

<p>Let Tamar be an example to us: an example of the extremes people may be driven to in order to right an injustice, and an example of how God honors the seemingly insignificant by raising them to a place of honor.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Tamar&rsquo;s twins are also another story of the expected order subverted: like Jacob, who takes his elder brother Esau&rsquo;s birthright, or Jacob blessing Joseph&rsquo;s son Ephraim as the firstborn even though Manasseh is older. Tamar&rsquo;s son Perez is not the one who put out his hand first but the one who was born first, and he is the son who is in the lineage of Jesus.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>Before I post about what I&rsquo;m enjoying this month, I want to say that the suffering of immigrant families is breaking my heart. It seems that outrage over separated families is growing, and it should; but the outrage also needs to become action so that innocent children, many whose parents fled horrific situations to seek asylum in the U.S., are no longer separated from their parents without concrete plans for reunification.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus made it clear that he valued children and he had harsh words for those who harm them. Christians cannot place their nationalism above the suffering of children, and so I ask you to consider taking action. Prayer is obviously important, but I have found these two resources helpful: Glennon Melton&rsquo;s organization <a href="https://momastery.com/blog/2018/05/30/lawmakers/">Together Rising</a> has raised money for legal representation for these children; she also gives concrete action steps. Jennifer Hofmann&rsquo;s <a href="https://jenniferhofmann.com/home/weekly-action-checklist-democrats-independents-republicans-conscience/">Americans of Conscience Checklist</a> covers much more than immigration, but she provides information about how to contact elected officials to voice concerns about a variety of issues, including immigration and specifically the separation of children from their parents at the border.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s easy for me at least to feel overwhelmed and discouraged, wondering what my single voice can possibly accomplish. But if I can join my voice with others, add my dollars to others, combine my prayers with others, we can accomplish much. Please join me in taking a step today towards love and justice for these children and their families.</em></p>

<p><em>And now, the things that are making me happy this month.</em></p>

<p>June has arrived, with green everywhere and flowers blooming and kids spending their days outside. I love this season of long days and still-cool evenings; even the rain drips cheerfully.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m especially loving our new house. The backyard has lush green grass perfect for running barefoot, plus a swing for hours of entertainment — and even a porch swing for the grownups. I have a climbing rose blooming pink by my front door, a clematis growing over a trellis, and a line of tomatoes in pots. So many lovely plants have put down their roots in the rich dark soil — I feel invited to do likewise.</p>

<p>Thinking of growing things, I&rsquo;m also incredibly excited about being a first-time CSA subscriber. I&rsquo;ve thought about doing CSAs for several years now but I&rsquo;ve never actually taken the plunge. I picked up my first box of spring produce on Saturday — kale, green onions, micro greens, salad greens, swiss chard — and I&rsquo;m so excited to see what else comes in the box over the rest of the summer.</p>

<p>But summer isn&rsquo;t only a time for fresh veggies and smores by the fire pit. It&rsquo;s also time to catch up on reading. What am I reading, you ask? Always far too much!</p>

<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Il2UK5"><em>The Spirit of Life</em>,</a> Jürgen Moltmann: still working my way through this one. I plan to actually finish it this month, but it has <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/05/pentecost">already reshaped</a> how I think about the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tu4kMM"><em>The Story of a Happy Marriage</em></a>, Ann Patchett: my little brother&rsquo;s awesome girlfriend (hi, Julia!) recommended Ann Patchett, and further recommended that I start with this book of essays. This was an excellent recommendation. I love Patchett&rsquo;s voice in these essays, and I&rsquo;m excited to read her novels now.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fiction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MSFjnw"><em>Three Parts Dead</em></a>, Max Gladstone: I&rsquo;m cheating a little, since I finished this at the end of May, but it&rsquo;s the first epic fantasy novel I&rsquo;ve enjoyed in a long time. It&rsquo;s a book about a necromancer and a dead god and the complications that arise when gods are real but may or may not be not worthy of religious devotion, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2yALPvT"><em>The Inquisitor&rsquo;s Tale</em></a>, Adam Gidwitz: an award-winning children&rsquo;s book set in medieval France. My eldest child enjoyed it, and so am I so far; here&rsquo;s hoping that it stays good and doesn&rsquo;t push me into cranky academic medievalist territory!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tpfwee"><em>Vicious</em></a>, V.E. Schwab: this one is at the top of my TBR pile. I flew threw her <em>Shades of Magic</em> series last winter, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I have also discovered fiction podcasts. I listened to one put out by Tor publishers last summer — <a href="https://tor-labs.com/steal-the-stars/"><em>Steal the Stars</em></a> — and loved finding radio drama for the digital age. So I when needed something to distract me while I painted and unpacked in the new house, I googled fiction podcasts and hit pay dirt.</p>

<p>My search turned up the show <a href="https://arsparadoxica.com"><em>Ars Paradoxica</em>,</a> and this was a wonderful (and hopefully not too creepily personalized) recommendation. <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is about a woman who accidentally invents time travel, and the spiraling effects of her invention. I love it so much. The show just ended after three seasons and the final episode is sitting in my podcast app; I want to know how it ends, but I&rsquo;m going to miss these characters so much when it&rsquo;s finally over and I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to listen yet.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the creative talent behind <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is also behind two other shows that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, <a href="https://www.whisperforge.org"><em>The Far Meridian</em> and <em>Star Tripper</em></a> (the latter is a brand-new comedy). And due to a cross-over episode, I discovered <a href="http://www.thebrightsessions.com"><em>The Bright Sessions</em>,</a> about a therapist for people with extraordinary abilities who herself has an agenda. (And other cross-over episodes and vocal talents have given me a few more to put on my to-listen list!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly a little surprised by how much I love these podcasts, especially since I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of audiobooks. I don&rsquo;t object to audiobooks — they totally count as &ldquo;real&rdquo; reading! — but I tend to space out and lose the narrative thread. But the dramatic aspects of the podcast seem to catch my imagination and hold my attention much better, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to have found them.</p>

<p>In between the moving and the gardening and the books and the podcasts, I haven&rsquo;t had time for movies. Not even <em>Avengers</em>, which is making me sad. But my husband and I are continuing our re-watch of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and I am happy to report that it continues to hold up both to a rewatch and to time, since it has been over 20 years since the first season aired.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also enjoying <em>Life in Pieces</em>, a short comedy that follows the various members of mostly functional extended family. It&rsquo;s light and funny and heartwarming without being sappy, which makes it perfect for evening relaxation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m loving the extra space that summer brings — space to read, to ride bikes, to sit on the deck with friends. I hope that this June brings growth and space for all of you as well, dear readers.</p>]]></description>

<p>If you pay any attention to news from the evangelical world, you&rsquo;ve heard about Paige Patterson, former president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) and prominent leader in the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). A little more than a month ago, an audio tape from 2000 surfaced in which Patterson defends counseling women to remain with their abusive spouses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">I responded to this initial revelation</a> on Arise, the blog run by Christians for Biblical Equality, and I argued that Patterson views women as having value only in relation to the men around them. I still think that this view of women is part of Patterson&rsquo;s problem, but over the last month the scandal just keeps growing. Patterson has now been fully removed from his position at SWBTS due to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/southern-baptist-leader-encouraged-a-woman-not-to-report-alleged-rape-to-police-and-told-her-to-forgive-assailant-she-says/?utm_term=.1e8a04901b7c">his mishandling of rape allegations.</a></p>

<p>But this scandal is just a part — if a large part — of a larger reckoning coming in the evangelical world.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has finally opened up</a> about the hurt caused by the treatment she&rsquo;s received from evangelical men.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html">Rachael Denhollandar,</a> a prominent witness in the case against serial molester Larry Nassar, has been calling the church as a whole, and particularly Sovereign Grace Ministries, to address sexual abuse in the church. Her former home church, initially resistant to her message, is now <a href="http://immanuelky.org/articles/we-were-rachaels-church/">beginning to grapple</a> with addressing sexual sin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/06/05/metoo-hits-southern-baptists-patriarchy-begins-tremble">Peggy Wehmeyer</a>, one of the first religion reporters on television, called evangelical leaders out for using the bible to mask and justify their patriarchy, recounting her own discouraging experiences as a young women who wanted to study the bible.</p>

<p><a href="https://albertmohler.com/2018/05/23/wrath-god-poured-humiliation-southern-baptist-convention/">Al Mohler penned a sober reflection</a> on the moment, urging evangelical leaders to view this moment as one of judgment for sins ignored.</p>

<p>I could name many others who are bravely speaking about their own experiences of abuse, pain or marginalization at the hands of evangelical leaders. And there are many leaders, both prominent ones like Al Mohler and ordinary pastors, who are waking up to the reality that the evangelical church is not immune from protecting abusers.</p>

<p>(And part of the scandal is, of course, the fact that many have been warning that this moment was coming — people like <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2013/december/my-interview-with-boz-tchividjian-part-1.html">Boz Tchividjian,</a> who has been dealing with addressing sexual abuse in evangelical churches for years. Evangelicals are waking up to a blaring alarm and a house ablaze.)</p>

<p>Painful as this moment is, the church needs to experience it. The evangelical church needs to lament the harm done to its members and take a long, hard look in the mirror.</p>

<p>And the evangelical church needs to repent of the patriarchy and misogyny that have lodged in the church under cover of faithfulness to scripture.</p>

<p>Some, like Al Mohler and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/amid-a-southern-baptist-scandal-some-evangelical-women-say-the-bibles-gender-roles-are-being-distorted-to-promote-sexism/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e32f6700e29e">Denny Burk,</a> believe that they can retain complementarian theology — theology that separates men and women into different roles and further both requires women to submit to their husbands and forbids women from leadership roles in the church. Some still believe that an abusive husband or dismissive pastor fails to <em>truly</em> apply complementarian theology, and thus represents individual failure rather than a flawed theology.</p>

<p>But no theology that diminishes the full humanity of any person can ever be healthy. Although most complementarians would assert that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, they are certainly not treated as equal in the eyes of the church. This is the failure of complementarian theology: the failure to treat women as beloved children of God just like men.</p>

<p>The problem is not a few bad apples. Better training and a commitment to actually report assault to the police are good and necessary; pastors must have a strong understanding of abuse dynamics so that they do not send spouses into dangerous situations in the hope that one martyred life will bring another to repentance.</p>

<p>But these actions will fail if the root cause remains unaddressed.</p>

<p>Misogyny and patriarchy are some of the oldest sins, according to the creation narrative in Genesis. Part of Eve&rsquo;s curse is that her husband will rule over her: patriarchy is rooted in the curse, along with pain in childbearing and in our work.</p>

<p>Jesus firmly rejects this patriarchy. He invites Mary to learn at his feet. He saves the woman accused of adultery from a painful death. He engages with the Samaritan woman at the well, heals the child of the Syrophoenician woman, performs his first miracle at the request of his mother. He entrusts the news of the resurrection to Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>Paul writes that Christ erases the social and value distinctions between women and men. He works alongside women to spread the gospel. He exhorts men to lay down their privilege, enshrined by Roman law, and treat their wives as co-heirs with them, treat their wives as Christ treated the church.</p>

<p>Patriarchy remains entrenched in most cultures around the world, although certainly modern American women suffer far less than their grandmothers or their sisters in other parts of the world. But the church should set an example by addressing and rooting out the sin of patriarchy when it emerges.</p>

<p>So I hope that as the SBC and the broader evangelical church reckon with their #MeToo moment that they will awaken to the gravity of the sin of patriarchy. I pray that we as Christians will work against our culture and against our sinfulness to see women as fully human, fully created in the image of God, fully able to pursue their callings and use their gifts.</p>

<p>May this moment be not just a PR disaster but a true beginning of lament, repentance, and the humility required to lay aside the benefits of patriarchy and allow women to be as equal in the church as they are in the eyes of God.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Arthurian Tropes, Nostalgia and Hope</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/the_librarians.jpg" alt="The Librarians" />

</figure></p>

<p>To unwind from the stresses of moving, my husband and I have been binge-watching <em>The Librarians.</em> The series continues on from the three movies of the same name, starring Noah Wylie as Flynn Carson, aka The Librarian — think a slightly dorky Indiana Jones who collects artifacts to protect the world from dangerous magic. The show, like the movies, has so much heart that the cheesiness is adorable.</p>

<p><em>The Librarians</em>, although set in world where magic is real, completely skips the grittiness that permeates (or infests, depending on your point of view) so much television fantasy. The stories end well; good triumphs; someone can always read the ancient, faded writing in a dead language and solve the problem within 50 minutes.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s feel-good fantasy where nerds are the real heroes, and I love it.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s also a show with numerous references to the Arthurian legend, which means that when I watch it I can&rsquo;t help but activate the academic part of my brain. After all, I spent years of my life reading, researching, analyzing and writing about Arthurian narratives, both medieval and modern.</p>

<p>While <em>The Librarians</em> deploys Arthurian elements rather haphazardly, its use of these tropes resonates with the nostalgia that has always been a part of the Arthurian legend. The stories of Arthur and his kingdom are always stories of a past imagined as better, purer, more noble than the future — a golden age of chivalry lost to the present, whether that present is the twelfth century or the fifteenth or the twenty-first.</p>

<p>But in this show, the nostalgia isn&rsquo;t just wistful; it&rsquo;s also hopeful. Take Galahad, the grail knight <em>par excellence</em> of medieval stories and a major character in <em>The Librarians.</em> In the show he does not seek the grail, but as in the grail legends he remains an idealist dedicated to high moral standards. He makes the world better by simply living, but also, crucially, by training the new librarians. Galahad is a tangible reminder of a better past who provides hope for a better future.</p>

<p>The past that Galahad represents is, of course, fictional: not just made rosy by historical distance, but actually fictional, since Galahad has no possible real-life counterpart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> And yet the nostalgia for a better, if fictional, past still works in the show to inspire a better future for the characters and, by extension, for us the viewers.</p>

<p>I admit that I sometimes can be cranky about nostalgic, romanticized views of the past — and especially the medieval past. Chivalry is violent and patriarchal; nobility depends on the oppression of the non-noble; and one has only to read Chaucer or Boccaccio to realize that medieval people were not somehow more moral than modern people.</p>

<p>And yet I fall for the combination of nostalgia and hope in <em>The Librarians</em> every time. I think it&rsquo;s because the nostalgia is not for a time period, but for a set of values that transcend time. In the show, Galahad, Excalibur, and even the Lady of the Lake stand for loyalty, courage, perseverance, knowledge and self-sacrifice. And when the cast of the show faces an enemy from the Arthurian narrative, the idea conveyed is that evil has always existed but can always be overcome by good.</p>

<p>The nostalgia for the past is transmuted into hope for the future through these transcendent values. And this alchemic process gives <em>The Librarians</em> its big, nerdy heart. Even when the odds look bleak, the values of human knowledge and human courage can still save the day.</p>

<p>Is <em>The Librarians</em> great television? Not really, to be honest. We live in a golden age of television, and many shows have better acting, effects and scripts. But the heart and the hope in this show point toward the power of ideals, a power that stretches through history to inspire us to be better versions of ourselves.</p>

<p>Arthur may have been a historical person; the knights Gawain, Kay, Bedevere and Mordred are connected with Arthur from nearly the earliest written references, although it&rsquo;s impossible to know if they are rooted in real people.

            <title>Life, Spirit and Pentecost</title>

<p>I have a confession: I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what to do with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I mean, I believe in the Holy Spirit. I&rsquo;m just not quite sure how this third person of the Trinity fits into my paradigm of faith. The branch of evangelicalism that shaped my childhood was cessationist, and cessationism holds that the gifts of the Holy Spirit — and particularly miracles, tongues and prophecy — were limited to the apostolic age and do not continue in the church today.</p>

<p>Although cessationists are fully orthodox and affirm the Trinity, in my experience this theology tends to diminish the role and importance of the Holy Spirit. The spirit becomes the odd member out of the Trinity, not embodied like Jesus or clearly defined like God the Father and, without the spiritual gifts, seemingly mostly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been cessationist for a long time; the Anglican Church in North America, my faith tradition for more than a decade now, has strong connections to charismatic movements and fully affirms the presence of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And yet I still am uncomfortable with the Spirit. However, the great thing about liturgy is that, like it or not, we encounter the basic doctrines of the church over the course of the lectionary and the church year.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the feast of Pentecost, the culmination of the liturgical season of Eastertide and the celebration of the gift of the Holy Spirit. Churchgoers wear red, orange and yellow while the altar and vestments change from celebratory white to fiery red to symbolize <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2&amp;version=NIV">the flames dancing over the heads of the disciples</a>.</p>

<p>Weird, right? Rushing wind, dancing flames, speaking in tongues: it&rsquo;s like something out of a fantasy novel.</p>

<p>But as my priest <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/a-preview-of-coming-attraction-kevin-miller">preached on the Holy Spirit,</a> he focused on the Spirit as the guarantee and foretaste of our coming resurrection life in Christ. Over at least the last decade, I&rsquo;ve grown to see the beauty of the resurrection and the glory of the promise that all will one day be made whole in Christ. But I&rsquo;d never made the connection between the Holy Spirit and this work before.</p>

<p>My priest&rsquo;s sermon dovetailed with the book I&rsquo;ve been reading by Jürgen Moltmann, <em>The Spirit of Life.</em> In this book, Moltmann talks about the Holy Spirit as the spirit of life, the spirit through whom we have life in all its forms, from creation to new life in Christ. And if the Spirit is creating new life in us, then part of that new life may involve the gifts and promptings and even miraculous interventions of the Spirit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to relate to the Spirit myself. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of undeniable encounters with the Spirit in the last year that I&rsquo;m still working to understand, and that I&rsquo;m still uncomfortable with on some level. But this framework of the Spirit as a spirit of life, as a guarantee and preview of the already-but-not-yet kingdom of heaven, creates a space for the spirit to work.</p>

<p>As long as I don&rsquo;t have to <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2018/4/19/tongues">speak in tongues.</a></p>]]></description>

            <title>Women in Christianity: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</title>

<p><em>Ungrateful, she who does not love you,</em></p>

<p><em>yet she who does you judge unchaste.</em></p>

<p><em>You men are such a foolish breed,</em></p>

<p><em>appraising with a faulty rule,</em></p>

<p><em>the first you charge with being cruel,</em></p>

<p><em>the second, easy, you decree.</em></p>

<p>These lines could have been written today, especially in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/canada/toronto-van-rampage.html">recent violent attack of a Canadian man</a> furious over &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; women who wouldn&rsquo;t date him. But they were written by a Mexican nun, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, in the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Sor Juana is a well-known figure in Mexico, but I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of her until a colleague recommended that we add her to the syllabus in the humanities course that I used to teach. She certainly deserves wider recognition in the English-speaking world, both for her literary works and for her engagement in theology.</p>

<p>Sor Juana was a child prodigy who learned to read at the age of 3 and, at 12, begged her mother to allow her to dress as a boy and travel to Mexico City to study (her mother refused). She did end up in Mexico City, however, as a lady-in-waiting in a noble Spanish family. There, she continued her education and quickly gained admiration for her intelligence. Although she received several marriage offers, she chose instead to join a convent.</p>

<p>Becoming a nun meant that Sor Juana could pursue her studies without the obligations of running a household or the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth. In the seventeenth century, a convent was the best option for a woman who wanted to engage in academic and intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>And yet entering holy orders brought Sor Juana a whole new set of challenges: those who did not believe that women should engage in theological study.</p>

<p>(As much as I wish this had changed, in just the last six months John Piper has sparked controversy by claiming that <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-john-pipers-words-should-grieve-men-too">women should not teach seminary</a> and <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has recounted the hostility</a> she faced during her brief stint in seminary. Much of the same resistance to women in theology remains today.)</p>

<p>This is where Sor Juana becomes an important figure in Christian history, and not just a brilliant young woman whose contributions to Spanish Golden Age literature earned her the title &ldquo;The Tenth Muse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1690, Sor Juana waded into a decades-long theological debate about divine acts of love towards humanity. At the request of a bishop, Sor Juana wrote down her critique of a particular Spanish theologian; this text, the <em>Athenagoric Letter,</em> circulated privately for a while, but soon the bishop published the essay without Sor Juana&rsquo;s knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>A brief side note on publishing while female is necessary to understand the reaction that ensued: in the seventeenth century, notions of decorum and propriety barred women from engaging in the public sphere. These ideas excluded women from politics and also made women&rsquo;s participation in any sort of public debate difficult — and publication was viewed as participation in public debates. Although Sor Juana did not choose to publish her essay, its publication meant that she nevertheless faced public censure as a woman who inappropriately and publicly critiqued a man.</p>

<p>The harshest criticism, lambasting Sor Juana for even entering the theological conversation, was written by the same bishop who published the <em>Athenagoric Letter.</em> He wrote under a female pseudonym, Sor Filotea de la Cruz, and urged Sor Juana in the strongest terms to give up her academic studies and instead devote herself to prayer — the proper work of a nun.</p>

<p>Sor Juana wrote a densely argued but passionate response to &ldquo;Sor Filotea&rdquo; (Sor Juana certainly knew the real identity of the author, although she plays along with the pseudonym). In her response, she argues cogently for educating women, even in theology, and for allowing them to write and teach. At one point, she asks the crucial question: &ldquo;My reason, such as it is, is it not as unfettered as his [the theologian who she argued against], as both issue from the same source?&rdquo; Although Sor Juana writes deferentially, she is keenly aware  that many of her critics would, indeed, see her as less capable of reason than a man.</p>

<p>But in her argument, she marshals support for educating women from a wide variety of authorities while building a rhetorical case that knowledge and love of God is best served by the wide-ranging knowledge gained through academic study. Sor Juana argues that understanding history, for example, helps everyone — including women — to better understand the bible.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, Sor Juana&rsquo;s response did not alleviate the mounting pressure to step away from public life and intellectual pursuits. Around 1693, she seems to have stopped writing and to have sold or given away her impressively large library, although it is unclear how willingly she did so. She spent the last years of her life in prayer and service, finally dying of the plague while caring for other sick nuns.</p>

<p>Sor Juana&rsquo;s life reminds us that, despite the many obstacles thrown in their path by patriarchy, women still know themselves to be created with the same reason as a man and still desire to turn this reason towards understanding the world and understanding God. But her death demonstrates that patriarchy can finally wear down even the most brilliant and passionate women.</p>

<p>Women in the western world today undoubtedly face fewer obstacles than Sor Juana. But the church in particular should take sober note of her story and work to encourage the gifts of all people, including women.</p>]]></description>

<p>In <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/01/01-08-2018-2017-reflections">January,</a> I chose a word for the year: space. I promised to give myself space to process, space to be in progress, space to be messy and imperfect and uncertain. Even space to take two weeks off blogging while I move to a new house.</p>

<p>I do have an actual space in my new house, though: an office just for me. Even though half the house is still a mess, my books are lined up behind me and I have my own desk and my own cozy chair and my own window. A room of my own, which is making me very happy.</p>

<p>Moving may be the worst — I hate the total chaos and disruption — but I&rsquo;m also very happy to be in a place where we&rsquo;ll stay for a while. I want to put down roots and grow into this space, instead of feeling like I can&rsquo;t take up too much space because it belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>Because, of course, giving myself space also means taking space, acknowledging that I can have the room to take deep breaths and to be honest about what I need and want. I&rsquo;ve spent too long giving space to others without asking for space myself. An office may be a small start (and to be honest, my husband had to push me to take it), but it&rsquo;s a wonderful start so far.</p>

<p>And thinking of starts and spaces, I also started a part-time job at my church as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministries. Anyone who knows me may be slightly puzzled, and it&rsquo;s certainly true that children&rsquo;s ministry has never been my passion. But as I&rsquo;m taking space to figure out my life post-academia, this opportunity for ministry has dropped into my lap, and I&rsquo;m excited to move from informal and volunteer service in my church to actually being on church staff.</p>

<p>(As a side note: I&rsquo;ve been bothered for quite a while that the only position for women on many church staffs is in children&rsquo;s ministry, so it&rsquo;s pretty ironic that this is where I&rsquo;m starting. But I&rsquo;m blessed to be in a church with women in a variety of leadership positions, including assistant rector; this job is far more likely to be a starting point in ministry than an ending one for me.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also just happy to be working again, even if it&rsquo;s only a few hours a week. Writing is great, and I&rsquo;ve been happy to be around more for my girls, but I&rsquo;ve missed being part of a bigger organization. I miss sharing ideas with and being challenged by others who share my passions, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to having that type of work community once again.</p>

<p>Springtime has finally arrived, with a new house and a new job, with literal and metaphorical space to explore new directions and to grow in my family, community and church. I&rsquo;m excited to see where this growth will take me even as I practice giving myself the space to grow.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;m back! I&rsquo;ll have a short life update on Thursday, but today I have a guest post up at CBE International responding to Paige Patterson&rsquo;s recent remarks about abuse and marriage:</p>

<hr />

<p>Last week, an audio tape from 2000 resurfaced in which Paige Patterson, currently the president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a prominent leader in the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), described counseling women to remain in abusive marriages.</p>

<p>The unfolding reckoning within the SBC is, on the surface, about a man who was moved by the suffering of a woman—in that Patterson likely does want to see abuse end. But sadly, his advice and his theology only perpetuate the devaluation of women and further endanger them. His response falls far short because it focuses only on the man and sidelines the needs, health, and safety of the woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://swbts.edu/news/releases/press-release-paige-patterson/">Patterson’s official statement</a> about this tape, and <a href="http://bpnews.net/50802/patterson-clarifies-domestic-violence-stance">in his interview</a> with Baptist Press News, he claims that he condemns abuse. But his words in his interview demonstrate a profound lack of concern about the suffering of women; he says, “‘minor non-injurious abuse which happens in so many marriages’—and which does not make the wife fear for her safety—might spur a woman to ‘pray [her husband] through this’ rather than leave.”</p>

<p>To be crystal clear, Patterson is suggesting that women should endure abuse because if they stay and suffer, they may be able to help their husbands become better people&hellip; .</p>

<p>So I tend to be a tiny bit over ambitious at times.</p>

<p>I also indulge in ironic understatements. I’ll leave it to you, dear reader, to consider how the two may be related.</p>

<p>Anyway. I have been trying to convince myself for the last few weeks that I actually can feed, clothe and occasionally bathe three small people; do a freelance project; apply and interview for a job at my church; lead a Girl Scout troop; move into a new house; and write two blog posts per week while also at least occasionally saying hello to my husband and, if I&rsquo;m lucky, sleeping.</p>

<p>But I’m once again getting my periodic reminder that I am not, in fact, either superhuman or in possession of a time turner. And since this blog neither whines at me, pays me, or operates on a definite timeline, I think it’s the thing that has to go for the next two weeks. I’m disappointed that I don’t get to write about Sor Juana and Tamar until next month, but unlike my truck rental they can wait.</p>

<p>I will be back to my normal posting schedule on May 7. I have it on good authority that the internet will still be around when I come back.</p>

<p>(Also? I’m writing this on my phone while waiting for one of my daughters to finish ballet, and I thoroughly hate it. I feel old now.)</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Experience of Preaching</title>

<p>Two weeks ago, I did something I&rsquo;ve never done before: with a roiling stomach and a slight quiver in my knees, I walked to the pulpit in my church to preach a sermon.</p>

<p>When my priest asked me back in January if I&rsquo;d be willing to preach, I jumped at the chance. I enjoy public speaking and I&rsquo;ve missed lecturing to the humanities students once a month, as I did at my academic job. And since we use the lectionary, I had an assigned passage already and no need to worry about coming up with a topic.</p>

<p>But despite my initial excitement, I was blindsided by my own emotional reaction to preaching.</p>

<p>I heard a woman preach for the first time less than a year ago. And despite believing in and supporting women preaching for at least the last ten years of my life, those previous twenty-five years of believing that women shouldn&rsquo;t preach still linger in my soul. And so I was overwhelmed with uncertainty, doubt and feelings of unworthiness as I began to prepare my sermon.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter that I affirm and argue for and write about women preaching. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve been writing regularly for Christians for Biblical Equality. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve led several adult Sunday School classes. Something about stepping into the pulpit brought out all of my insecurity. I could, and do, argue that women, in general, should preach. But what about when &ldquo;women&rdquo; meant me, specifically? Could I do this? Could I preach?</p>

<p>I was, either ironically or appropriately, preaching on the story of Thomas and his doubts, from John 20. My central point was that Jesus meets us in our doubts, drawing us out of those doubts and into himself. I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced periods of doubt about my faith, especially when my critical thinking turns into cynical thinking. But now I was drowning in doubt about my <em>worthiness</em> to preach.</p>

<p>And I want to be clear that my insecurity was about my intrinsic <em>worthiness</em> to preach, my status in the eyes of God. I never doubted my skills in studying a text, preparing a message, and speaking to the church. I&rsquo;m actually pretty good at all of that, and after fourteen years of teaching I have plenty of experience in prepping, teaching and speaking. So I never felt unsure about my skill or my talent; the doubt went much deeper, to the question of whether I as a woman could serve God and the church by preaching — whether God wanted that kind of service from me.</p>

<p>And so, I felt weirdly divided: I thoroughly enjoyed prepping the sermon, but I felt existential anxiety every time I thought about actually preaching it.</p>

<p>Then came Holy Week. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting, honestly, to meet God in any deep way; the previous month had been busy and stressful and not incredibly conducive to cultivating spiritual openness for the greatest feast of the Christian year. And yet, kneeling at the foot of the cross on Good Friday to pray, I knew exactly what I needed to leave there at the cross, what I needed Jesus to take up for me: my feelings of unworthiness.</p>

<p>Much to my amazement, Jesus did take them from me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not much of one for spiritual experiences; I tend to be much more cerebral than emotional, and I&rsquo;m still not entirely comfortable with that strange and mysterious third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. But I experienced an otherwise inexplicable emotional relief that Friday night at the cross. The burden and shame of my unworthiness as a woman disappeared.</p>

<p>I was still nervous the next week when I got up to preach. This was a new audience, and they didn&rsquo;t need to pay attention in order to get a passing grade on an exam. And I certainly felt the weight of preaching: getting something wrong about Shakespeare probably won&rsquo;t affect a student&rsquo;s entire life, but getting something wrong about Jesus might hurt one of my listeners. And yet I no longer felt unworthy as a woman; I felt beloved by God and supported by my church community.</p>

<p>And I even enjoyed myself, stretching muscles that I hadn&rsquo;t used in a while.</p>

<p>I hope that I&rsquo;ll be able to preach again. I imagine that I&rsquo;ll still feel doubt and uncertainty and I&rsquo;ll still wonder whether God is really calling me, specifically. But Jesus meets us in our doubts and calls us to serve him; how can I respond better than with Thomas' affirmation, &ldquo;My lord and my God&rdquo;?</p>

            <title>Snowy April: Reflections on Mind, Heart and Poetry</title>

<p><em>I started writing this post a week ago, to go up on the 12th — then I spent the weekend at the Festival of Faith and Writing and didn&rsquo;t actually post anything. I assumed I&rsquo;d have to rework the beginning because it&rsquo;s April and it should be spring … but I woke up to snow on the ground yesterday so Henryson&rsquo;s April is still much closer to my reality than Chaucer&rsquo;s!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the opening to Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>Canterbury Tales,</em> with the sweet showers of April bringing life and energy to places and people parched by the drought of winter. Actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how my April has made me want to huddle indoors, by a fire, rather than venturing out on any sort of pilgrimage (even just to the grocery store). I feel much more like the narrator of Robert Henryson&rsquo;s <em>Testament of Cresseid,</em> who ventures outside on an April night in Scotland to watch Venus rise, but is defeated by the whistling north wind and returns indoors to thaw by his fire.</p>

<p>I try to bolster myself during this long, cold spring with thoughts of superiority; after all, <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/byron/don-juan/1/">as Byron asserts,</a> &ldquo;Happy the nations of the moral north!&rdquo; But then I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the assertion that northern people (that is, Europeans) are morally superior to other people groups, even if Byron with his notorious lack of morality certainly meant this line as a sly joke. So I turn to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44428/the-negro-speaks-of-rivers">Langston Hughes</a> for an antidote, with his soul grown deep like a wide, warm river.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the power of poetry last week, when I spent twenty minutes reading poems to a group of first grade students (including one of my daughters). <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope is the thing with feathers&rdquo;</a> lost them, sadly, although Dickinson is never my favorite so I secretly sympathize. But they loved <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58421/on-paper">&ldquo;on paper&rdquo; by Jacqueline Woodson</a> and they giggled through William Carlos Williams' <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say">&ldquo;This is Just to Say.&rdquo;</a> Perhaps best of all, they were amazed that Billy Collins would write a poem about <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55737/cheerios">Cheerios,</a> which is humorous enough to capture a first-grader but hooks us adults with its meditation on age and aging and time.</p>

<p>When I taught English classes, I read poetry regularly. I read poems from Homer and Sappho; Dante, Chaucer, and Marie de France; Donne, Herbert, Mary Sidney, and Milton. I even, occasionally, ventured into more modern poetry. But since leaving my teaching job nearly a year ago, I&rsquo;ve read much less poetry. I have at least one prose novel going all the time (often more), but as I was searching for poems to bring to my daughter&rsquo;s class I realized how much I miss reading poetry.</p>

<p>Poetry has an evocative and emotional power that often evades prose, even the most lyrical and powerful prose. All writers must wrestle with words, striving to convey ideas and emotions to their readers. But the poet must be sensitive to the meaning of the words and their sounds, the ideas and the rhythms conveyed by each word. But the very best poems do this in a way that bypasses our head and goes straight to our heart.</p>

<p>Even the most intellectual of poets, like John Donne or T.S. Eliot, offer a depth beyond intellectual puzzles and learned allusions. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud">Donne&rsquo;s Holy Sonnet 10</a> contains a brief argument against the power of death, but the poem&rsquo;s punch comes not in its logic but its resounding final lines: &ldquo;One short sleep past, we wake eternally / And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.&rdquo; The weight and finality of the heavy syllables in the last line underscore emotionally the truth that death will indeed die.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why the Bible contains so much poetry. The Psalms, of course, but also various songs and hymns are preserved throughout scripture. Rhythm and music help people remember, especially crucial in largely illiterate cultures; but this memory goes beyond intellect to embed itself in the soul as poetry links mind and emotion.</p>

<p>I have, at times, wished that the bible were more like a guidebook, or perhaps a systematic theology. But we are more than our minds; we are our bodies and our emotions and our communities. God wants to reach us in every aspect of our being, and so in addition to Paul we have the parable of Jesus; in addition to the chronicles of the kings we have psalms; and the whole of scripture is framed by poems about creation and new creation.</p>

<p>So this month, in celebration of poetry, curl up by the fire (or if you&rsquo;re lucky, find a pleasant park bench) and read a poem. Read a psalm, or Mary&rsquo;s magnificat, or Miriam&rsquo;s song; read John Donne or George Herbert or Mary Sidney or, for a giggle, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43639/the-disappointment">Aphra Behn&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Disappointment.&rdquo;</a> Find a new poet or revisit an old friend, and engage your mind and your heart.</p>]]></description>
