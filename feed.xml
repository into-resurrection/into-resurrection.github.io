<p>This could be a very short blog post: my answer to the question of whether I am still an evangelical is that I&rsquo;m really not sure. Probably not. But maybe.</p>

<p>I started drifting from evangelicalism so gradually that I hardly noticed at first. I grew up evangelical and I attended college at the evangelical Harvard (aka Wheaton College), but at Wheaton I began to understand that &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; are not synonyms.</p>

<p>I became Anglican, and while some Anglicans consider themselves evangelical, others don&rsquo;t — to be Anglican need not mean being evangelical.</p>

<p>And I started graduate school at a highly-ranked state university. I had already begun to sour on the culture war mentality that permeates much of evangelicalism, and as I lived and developed relationships outside the evangelical bubble I became completely disenchanted with the &ldquo;us against the world&rdquo; mentality of the evangelical culture wars.</p>

<p>To me, evangelicalism had become too tightly linked to conservative politics and to doctrines I no longer held, like complementarianism and creationism. Plus, I never felt particularly connected to evangelicalism, probably due to my uneasiness from a young age about conversionism. And so I simply let &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; slip from my Christian identity — I had no reason to renounce it, but no reason to embrace it either.</p>

<p>And then 2016 happened.</p>

<p>I was angry at evangelicals. What happened to the values I had been taught growing up? How could the same people who (rightly) deplored Bill Clinton&rsquo;s behavior turn around and justify similar, and worse, behavior by Trump? How could compassionate conservatism turn into dehumanizing rhetoric against people of color?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> How could evangelicals sell their souls for political gain?</p>

<p>But I was also, for the first time, a tiny bit hopeful for evangelicalism. A handful of prominent evangelicals vocally criticized Trump. They pointed out the hypocrisy of supporting Trump. They urged their fellow evangelicals not to support someone who bragged about assaulting women, who displayed breathtaking arrogance even about matters of faith, who lied continually.</p>

<p>Their words were clearly too little, too late; the soul of evangelicalism had become corrupted long before the 2016 election. But for the first time, I saw evangelical leaders waking up to the problems inherent in linking doctrine and political power.</p>

<p>I had no desire to identify as evangelical, though. I felt as if I was watching an old friend I had fallen out of touch with begin to grow a conscience — a good development, but no longer one that affected me.</p>

<p>And then, in April, I attended a panel at the Festival of Faith and Writing with essayists from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830845372/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=intoresurrect-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0830845372&amp;linkId=942f105619cef033b5048ad7404a2d6d">Still Evanglical.</a> The four women on the panel — Kathy Khang, Karen Swallow Prior, Deidra Riggs, and Sandra Maria Van Opstal — were heartbreakingly honest about the challenges of remaining evangelical. Three of these women are women of color, whose challenges as members of evangelical churches are even greater. All of them see themselves as prophetic voices calling evangelicals back to Jesus, back to love, away from the seductive call of political power and nationalism.</p>

<p>Part of me — if I&rsquo;m honest, a large part — wants to wash my hands of evangelicalism. Evangelicals have made their bed, so to speak; let them reap the consequences of their actions. Let them fade into political irrelevance, let them be excoriated by the press, let them suffer for the hypocrisy that allows them to proclaim that families matter and then justify family separation as a deterrent for immigration, that allows them to fight against abortion and turn around to shame women in their churches who are unmarried and pregnant, that allows them to be incredibly sensitive about the smallest slight against themselves while ignoring the oppression of so many in America.</p>

<p>But those feelings are not particularly charitable. Much as I would like to dismiss evangelicals as power-hungry hypocrites, I know too many who are not. I do believe evangelicalism as a whole have lost its way, emphasizing moralism at the expense of love and never examining the painful racism and sexism embedded in the church.</p>

<p>But if they have lost their way, they can find it again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it&rsquo;s my job to help evangelicals find their way. I&rsquo;ve been on the edges for so long that I&rsquo;m comfortable here, learning alongside others who love Jesus and respect the bible but who find that evangelicalism doesn&rsquo;t help us do either well. I&rsquo;m probably not still evangelical.</p>

<p>But I honor and admire the work of those who call evangelicals to repentance, to those who speak prophetically even when their audience responds with hostility. I pray for the healing of the evangelical church so that it can once again be light and salt, known for being Jesus in the world.</p>

            <title>Loving the Least of These</title>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>I finished this piece on Wednesday, June 20 — just before Trump signed an executive order halting family separations. I hope this order is a reaction to many voices raised in outrage, but I have little trust in this administration. I believe that immigrants and asylum-seekers will continue to be oppressed in other, often more subtle ways. Also, as of today, there is no plan for reuniting separated children and families. We must remain committed to seeing the least of these as Christ sees them, not as our government sees them.</em></p>

<p>I always think that the scariest passage in scripture is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:34-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 28:34-46.</a> It&rsquo;s worth quoting in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote><p>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</p>

<p>“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</p>

<p>“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p>

<p>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’</p>

<p>“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’</p>

<p>“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</p>

<p>“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Protestants have long held that faith alone brings salvation; we do not need to work to earn our salvation. What the reformers meant by <em>sola fide</em> is that only the work of Christ can accomplish salvation; no human effort can reconcile us to God. But despite this basic reality acknowledged by all orthodox Christians, over and over again scripture reminds us that our actions matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:20&amp;version=NIV">James</a> tells us that faith without works is useless. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:12&amp;version=NIV">Paul</a> tells us to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Throughout scripture, faith and obedience, faith and action, go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>So we should not be surprised when Jesus declares that those who ignored the least of these — the poor, the outcast, the marginalized, the ill, the uneducated, the unloved and unlovely, the oppressed — have ignored him.</p>

<p>If our faith does not lead us to compassionate action, what good is that faith? That faith becomes a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">clanging cymbal</a>, a faith devoid of love and empathy, a faith that annoys and provokes without contributing anything valuable to those who hear it.</p>

<p>If our love for Jesus doesn&rsquo;t move us to care for the least of these, do we really know Jesus at all?</p>

<hr />

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a hypothetical discussion, of course. The situation on the border as children are pulled away from their parents demands that we respond. We cannot afford to be numb or callous, even when the government or pundits ask us to shrug our shoulders at the suffering inflicted on whole families.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and someone uses the bible to defend that suffering.</p>

<p>Jesus is crammed into a building with hundreds of others, and someone says it is basically summer camp.</p>

<p>Jesus is separated from his family, but someone says he&rsquo;ll be fine in foster care or whatever.</p>

<p>Jesus is pulled from his mother&rsquo;s breast, but someone says it is necessary for national security.</p>

<p>Jesus is suffering, and our government wants us to ignore that suffering. They want us to see his suffering as not real suffering, or as deserved suffering, or as someone else&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>But as Christians, our ultimate loyalty isn&rsquo;t to our government. It&rsquo;s to the kingdom of God. Paul may tell us to obey the governing authorities, but he does not tell us to trust in them. We must see people as Jesus sees them, not as the ruling powers and authorities see them.</p>

<p>We must see Jesus <em>in</em> people, particularly in the people those in power want us to fear. For what do we gain by dehumanizing others in order to gain favor from those in power? What good comes from selling our souls to power, to nationalism, to a pragmatic <em>quid pro quo</em>?</p>

<p>Will we sell our souls for the illusion of safety, for the supposed good of our nation? Will we accept the trauma of another as the cost of our own comfort? Will we place nationalist values above the values of the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p>Or will we refuse to be complicit with the powers of this world? Will we refuse to  remain silent as those in power inflict cruel suffering on the least of these, on people who bear the image of God, on people with whom Jesus identifies?</p>

<p>We must take a stand. We must pray, and donate, and make phone calls; we must march and write and vote and refuse to accept the dehumanization and oppression of these beloved children of God.</p>

<p>This is a moment when we can remind the world that faith is not a clanging cymbal but a motivation to defend the defenseless, to help the helpless, to show love to others no matter what they look like or where they came from.</p>

<p>And more than showing the world, we serve Jesus as we work for the good of the least of these. Let us not be found empty-handed and cold-hearted when we see Jesus before us, hungry, thirsty and imprisoned.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Fathers Day and the Fatherhood of God</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>Father&rsquo;s Day rarely carries the emotional weight of Mother&rsquo;s Day. The whole tone of the holiday is different, lighter: fathers get ties and grilling utensils, not hand-drawn cards and crafts make with handprints. Father&rsquo;s Day cards are likely to be jokey, or at least less sentimental than Mother&rsquo;s Day cards. Breakfast in bed, with the family curled up together, is for mothers; backyard grilling is for fathers.</p>

<p>In recent years, I have seen a upwelling of sensitivity around the emotional landmines of Mother&rsquo;s Day. People write articles and Facebook posts reminding others to be sensitive to those who want to be mothers but aren&rsquo;t, who have difficult relationships with their own mothers or children, who have lost mothers or children.</p>

<p>I saw one such Facebook post about fathers this weekend.</p>

<p>This situation shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. Modern American culture still doesn&rsquo;t have much room for men&rsquo;s emotions, particularly the emotions around tenderness and nurturing that we associate with mothers. It seems to me that there has been some cultural improvement in this direction, but our <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">societal notions of masculinity</a> still have little room for men&rsquo;s emotions beyond anger.</p>

<p>To be clear, I know many men with tender hearts, men who are nurturing fathers who freely show their emotional selves to their children and to others. But cultural ideas about masculinity make it difficult for many men, for many fathers, to express their full emotional selves.</p>

<p>These notions about manhood damage men, pushing them to repress and deny the full range of human emotions. But these ideas about masculinity can also interfere with our conception of God, especially God the Father.</p>

<p>When we think of God the Father through the lens of our cultural definition of manhood, and even fatherhood, it becomes easy to imagine God as distant, unavailable, even angry and easily provoked. But when we do this, we risk missing the tender and nurturing care integral to God&rsquo;s fatherhood.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite image of God as nurturing father comes from the book of Hosea. God says to Hosea, “It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms; but they did not realize it was I who healed them. I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love. To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek, and I bent down to feed them” (Hos. 11:3-4, NIV).</p>

<p>These images of God helping a toddler walk and feeding a young child remind us that God’s fatherly love is full of tenderness and patience. God nurtures by feeding a toddler, helping that toddler walk — doing for the child what they cannot do for themselves. And I love that image of God lifting a child to his cheek: this shows a moment of care and connection, a moment when that child feels safe, secure, and the center of a father&rsquo;s undivided attention.</p>

<p>This image of God as father shows a father who is present, patient, encouraging, tender — not distant. In the context of Hosea, God is angry and disappointed at how far his children have strayed. But even in that anger God reminds his people that he has loved them and still loves them, that he still wants to nurture them if they will allow themselves to be nurtured.</p>

<p>God frequently uses parenthood as a metaphor for God&rsquo;s love and care for us, and so our own conceptions of fatherhood and motherhood matter for our ideas about God. Let us remember that God shows us tenderness and nurturing care, and let us free men from cultural ideas of masculinity so that they can fully embrace and show their ability to be tender nurturers.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this idea of fatherhood as distant is responsible for the incredibly problematic idea of God punishing his son instead of us. This idea fits with cultural conceptions of masculinity and fatherhood, but misses the reality of the Trinity: God isn&rsquo;t punishing Jesus; rather, God is taking on God&rsquo;s own pain and disappointment in order to restore the relationship between God and humanity.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <title>Subversion in Scripture: Tamar and Judah</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/Rembrandts_school_Tamar.jpg" alt="School of Rembrandt Judah and Tamar" />

</figure></p>

<p>Back at the end of March, I launched a new recurring series on <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/subversion-in-scripture">subversion in scripture.</a> In this series, I want to highlight how the bible repeatedly undermines our expectations about power and authority. The incarnation and then then death of Jesus exemplify this subversion best: the creator of the universe became a helpless child and then died at the hands of a great empire. But through his life and death, Jesus conquered a much greater power and evil than any earthly empire and, in so doing, upended our comfortable notions about how power works.</p>

<p>And yet, in America in 2018 we Christians are often far too ready to place our trust in power, our hope in influence, our confidence in our political stances and leaders. It&rsquo;s easy to point fingers at the 81% of evangelicals who supported Trump, and I certainly think that this part of the evangelical church needs to reexamine its relationship to nationalism and politics.</p>

<p>But those of use who aren&rsquo;t evangelical, or aren&rsquo;t sure if we&rsquo;re still evangelical, or who are evangelical but not Christian nationalists, still need the reminder that the first shall be last, that a little child shall lead them, that the foolishness of Christ humbles the wise.</p>

<p>I need the reminder that God is at work in and through the seemingly weak and marginalized, that I will find Jesus where I least expect, that God does not need our achievements or our perfection.</p>

<p>And I also need the reminder that God is a God of justice who will right the wrongs done by the powerful to the weak.</p>

<p>We find this God who does justice and humbles the powerful in the story of Tamar and Judah. This story, told in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+38&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 38,</a> is one of the many odd Old Testament stories, narratives that leave us slightly puzzled about why they were included. In the narrative, Tamar marries one of Judah&rsquo;s son — Judah, who is the eldest son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Judah&rsquo;s son, Tamar&rsquo;s first husband, dies; Tamar then becomes the wife of Judah&rsquo;s second son, Onan. This second son, however, refuses to father a child with Tamar since that child would be considered his brother&rsquo;s rather than his.</p>

<p>God sees this refusal as wicked, so Onan also dies. At this point, Judah&rsquo;s third son is too young to take a wife, so Tamar lives in Judah&rsquo;s house as a widow in the expectation that she will be given a third husband.</p>

<p>A brief history break here: in the patriarchal culture of the Old Testament, women had few individual rights and thus needed men to care for them. A father, then a husband, then a son: without this progression of men in her life, a woman risked poverty and worse. Without a son, Tamar&rsquo;s future is bleak and even her present is tenuous, since she depends entirely on the good will of her father-in-law Judah.</p>

<p>And so, when Tamar sees that Judah&rsquo;s third son is old enough to marry and Judah has made no move to marry the two of them, an inaction that prevents Tamar from having a son, Tamar takes matters into her own hands. Disguised as a shrine prostitute, she sleeps with Judah himself and becomes pregnant, keeping Judah&rsquo;s seal as payment — although Judah does not know who she is.</p>

<p>When Judah hears that Tamar is pregnant, he furiously orders her execution. But confronted with the evidence that Tamar&rsquo;s child is his, Judah reverses his judgment and declares that Tamar &ldquo;is more righteous than I, since I wouldn&rsquo;t give her to my son Shelah&rdquo; (Gen. 38:26, NIV).</p>

<p>That &ldquo;more righteous than I&rdquo; should give us pause. Typically, disguising oneself as a prostitute in order to get pregnant by ones' father-in-law is frowned upon, both now and centuries ago. And yet Judah not only acknowledges her cleverness in securing a child for herself, he declares that her decision to take this action is <em>righteous.</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s righteous because, despite her low status as a childless widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s household, Tamar takes steps to address the injustice Judah has committed by denying her a husband and thus a son. Judah recognizes that Tamar has corrected his wrong, and he praises her for doing so.</p>

<p>Moreover, God blesses Tamar&rsquo;s subversive action. She gives birth to not only one son, but two. And in another scriptural oddity, as Tamar gives birth one twin sticks his hand out first and is designated the firstborn — but then he withdraws his hand and his brother is actually born first. I don&rsquo;t envy Tamar&rsquo;s labor, but she ends up with essentially <em>two</em> first-born sons: a doubled blessing from God and doubled promise of a secure future.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Tamar&rsquo;s story is fascinating for its glimpse into ancient customs and the status of women — a status that led Tamar to take a dangerous risk as she sought justice for herself. She&rsquo;s a woman from scripture whose bravery and determination are worth hearing more about.</p>

<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>In Matthew&rsquo;s gospel, Matthew names four women in his genealogy of Jesus. The first of these women? Tamar (Matt. 1:3).</p>

<p>Yes, Tamar makes it into the genealogy of Jesus by tricking her father-in-law into sleeping with her. Which is not to say that she is somehow more sinful than the men in the genealogy: the line from Abraham to Jesus is full of men whose actions are far from ideal. But with only four women listed to the forty men — and listed alongside, not in place of, the fathers and sons — we must ask why Tamar makes Matthew&rsquo;s list.</p>

<p>From the Genesis account, what we learn about Tamar is that she holds a powerful man accountable for the injustice that he has done to her. Her methods may be unorthodox, but Judah himself cannot fault them: she was driven to such drastic action by his own failure and inaction, as he himself recognizes.</p>

<p>Judah recognizes Tamar&rsquo;s righteousness; God blesses her with two sons; the writers and editors of Genesis include her story as an integral episode in the lives of Israel&rsquo;s patriarchs; and finally, Matthew lists her in the genealogy of Jesus.</p>

<p>Tamar is a woman who rights the wrong done to her, who stands up for justice when no one else will. In so doing she humbles the powerful Judah — and earns his respect. She is one of the least of these, living on the margins of her household as a widow in her father-in-law&rsquo;s house. But scripture shows us through the birth of her sons and through her inclusion in both Genesis and Matthew that God was on her side, on the side of the weak and the powerless.</p>

<p>Let Tamar be an example to us: an example of the extremes people may be driven to in order to right an injustice, and an example of how God honors the seemingly insignificant by raising them to a place of honor.</p>

<p>Tamar&rsquo;s twins are also another story of the expected order subverted: like Jacob, who takes his elder brother Esau&rsquo;s birthright, or Jacob blessing Joseph&rsquo;s son Ephraim as the firstborn even though Manasseh is older. Tamar&rsquo;s son Perez is not the one who put out his hand first but the one who was born first, and he is the son who is in the lineage of Jesus.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>Before I post about what I&rsquo;m enjoying this month, I want to say that the suffering of immigrant families is breaking my heart. It seems that outrage over separated families is growing, and it should; but the outrage also needs to become action so that innocent children, many whose parents fled horrific situations to seek asylum in the U.S., are no longer separated from their parents without concrete plans for reunification.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus made it clear that he valued children and he had harsh words for those who harm them. Christians cannot place their nationalism above the suffering of children, and so I ask you to consider taking action. Prayer is obviously important, but I have found these two resources helpful: Glennon Melton&rsquo;s organization <a href="https://momastery.com/blog/2018/05/30/lawmakers/">Together Rising</a> has raised money for legal representation for these children; she also gives concrete action steps. Jennifer Hofmann&rsquo;s <a href="https://jenniferhofmann.com/home/weekly-action-checklist-democrats-independents-republicans-conscience/">Americans of Conscience Checklist</a> covers much more than immigration, but she provides information about how to contact elected officials to voice concerns about a variety of issues, including immigration and specifically the separation of children from their parents at the border.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s easy for me at least to feel overwhelmed and discouraged, wondering what my single voice can possibly accomplish. But if I can join my voice with others, add my dollars to others, combine my prayers with others, we can accomplish much. Please join me in taking a step today towards love and justice for these children and their families.</em></p>

<p><em>And now, the things that are making me happy this month.</em></p>

<p>June has arrived, with green everywhere and flowers blooming and kids spending their days outside. I love this season of long days and still-cool evenings; even the rain drips cheerfully.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m especially loving our new house. The backyard has lush green grass perfect for running barefoot, plus a swing for hours of entertainment — and even a porch swing for the grownups. I have a climbing rose blooming pink by my front door, a clematis growing over a trellis, and a line of tomatoes in pots. So many lovely plants have put down their roots in the rich dark soil — I feel invited to do likewise.</p>

<p>Thinking of growing things, I&rsquo;m also incredibly excited about being a first-time CSA subscriber. I&rsquo;ve thought about doing CSAs for several years now but I&rsquo;ve never actually taken the plunge. I picked up my first box of spring produce on Saturday — kale, green onions, micro greens, salad greens, swiss chard — and I&rsquo;m so excited to see what else comes in the box over the rest of the summer.</p>

<p>But summer isn&rsquo;t only a time for fresh veggies and smores by the fire pit. It&rsquo;s also time to catch up on reading. What am I reading, you ask? Always far too much!</p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Il2UK5"><em>The Spirit of Life</em>,</a> Jürgen Moltmann: still working my way through this one. I plan to actually finish it this month, but it has <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/05/pentecost">already reshaped</a> how I think about the Holy Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tu4kMM"><em>The Story of a Happy Marriage</em></a>, Ann Patchett: my little brother&rsquo;s awesome girlfriend (hi, Julia!) recommended Ann Patchett, and further recommended that I start with this book of essays. This was an excellent recommendation. I love Patchett&rsquo;s voice in these essays, and I&rsquo;m excited to read her novels now.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Fiction:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MSFjnw"><em>Three Parts Dead</em></a>, Max Gladstone: I&rsquo;m cheating a little, since I finished this at the end of May, but it&rsquo;s the first epic fantasy novel I&rsquo;ve enjoyed in a long time. It&rsquo;s a book about a necromancer and a dead god and the complications that arise when gods are real but may or may not be not worthy of religious devotion, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2yALPvT"><em>The Inquisitor&rsquo;s Tale</em></a>, Adam Gidwitz: an award-winning children&rsquo;s book set in medieval France. My eldest child enjoyed it, and so am I so far; here&rsquo;s hoping that it stays good and doesn&rsquo;t push me into cranky academic medievalist territory!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2tpfwee"><em>Vicious</em></a>, V.E. Schwab: this one is at the top of my TBR pile. I flew threw her <em>Shades of Magic</em> series last winter, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to this one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I have also discovered fiction podcasts. I listened to one put out by Tor publishers last summer — <a href="https://tor-labs.com/steal-the-stars/"><em>Steal the Stars</em></a> — and loved finding radio drama for the digital age. So I when needed something to distract me while I painted and unpacked in the new house, I googled fiction podcasts and hit pay dirt.</p>

<p>My search turned up the show <a href="https://arsparadoxica.com"><em>Ars Paradoxica</em>,</a> and this was a wonderful (and hopefully not too creepily personalized) recommendation. <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is about a woman who accidentally invents time travel, and the spiraling effects of her invention. I love it so much. The show just ended after three seasons and the final episode is sitting in my podcast app; I want to know how it ends, but I&rsquo;m going to miss these characters so much when it&rsquo;s finally over and I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to listen yet.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the creative talent behind <em>Ars Paradoxica</em> is also behind two other shows that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed, <a href="https://www.whisperforge.org"><em>The Far Meridian</em> and <em>Star Tripper</em></a> (the latter is a brand-new comedy). And due to a cross-over episode, I discovered <a href="http://www.thebrightsessions.com"><em>The Bright Sessions</em>,</a> about a therapist for people with extraordinary abilities who herself has an agenda. (And other cross-over episodes and vocal talents have given me a few more to put on my to-listen list!)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly a little surprised by how much I love these podcasts, especially since I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of audiobooks. I don&rsquo;t object to audiobooks — they totally count as &ldquo;real&rdquo; reading! — but I tend to space out and lose the narrative thread. But the dramatic aspects of the podcast seem to catch my imagination and hold my attention much better, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to have found them.</p>

<p>In between the moving and the gardening and the books and the podcasts, I haven&rsquo;t had time for movies. Not even <em>Avengers</em>, which is making me sad. But my husband and I are continuing our re-watch of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and I am happy to report that it continues to hold up both to a rewatch and to time, since it has been over 20 years since the first season aired.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also enjoying <em>Life in Pieces</em>, a short comedy that follows the various members of mostly functional extended family. It&rsquo;s light and funny and heartwarming without being sappy, which makes it perfect for evening relaxation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m loving the extra space that summer brings — space to read, to ride bikes, to sit on the deck with friends. I hope that this June brings growth and space for all of you as well, dear readers.</p>]]></description>

<p>If you pay any attention to news from the evangelical world, you&rsquo;ve heard about Paige Patterson, former president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) and prominent leader in the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). A little more than a month ago, an audio tape from 2000 surfaced in which Patterson defends counseling women to remain with their abusive spouses.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/response-paige-pattersons-comments-abuse">I responded to this initial revelation</a> on Arise, the blog run by Christians for Biblical Equality, and I argued that Patterson views women as having value only in relation to the men around them. I still think that this view of women is part of Patterson&rsquo;s problem, but over the last month the scandal just keeps growing. Patterson has now been fully removed from his position at SWBTS due to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/southern-baptist-leader-encouraged-a-woman-not-to-report-alleged-rape-to-police-and-told-her-to-forgive-assailant-she-says/?utm_term=.1e8a04901b7c">his mishandling of rape allegations.</a></p>

<p>But this scandal is just a part — if a large part — of a larger reckoning coming in the evangelical world.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has finally opened up</a> about the hurt caused by the treatment she&rsquo;s received from evangelical men.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html">Rachael Denhollandar,</a> a prominent witness in the case against serial molester Larry Nassar, has been calling the church as a whole, and particularly Sovereign Grace Ministries, to address sexual abuse in the church. Her former home church, initially resistant to her message, is now <a href="http://immanuelky.org/articles/we-were-rachaels-church/">beginning to grapple</a> with addressing sexual sin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2018/06/05/metoo-hits-southern-baptists-patriarchy-begins-tremble">Peggy Wehmeyer</a>, one of the first religion reporters on television, called evangelical leaders out for using the bible to mask and justify their patriarchy, recounting her own discouraging experiences as a young women who wanted to study the bible.</p>

<p><a href="https://albertmohler.com/2018/05/23/wrath-god-poured-humiliation-southern-baptist-convention/">Al Mohler penned a sober reflection</a> on the moment, urging evangelical leaders to view this moment as one of judgment for sins ignored.</p>

<p>I could name many others who are bravely speaking about their own experiences of abuse, pain or marginalization at the hands of evangelical leaders. And there are many leaders, both prominent ones like Al Mohler and ordinary pastors, who are waking up to the reality that the evangelical church is not immune from protecting abusers.</p>

<p>(And part of the scandal is, of course, the fact that many have been warning that this moment was coming — people like <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2013/december/my-interview-with-boz-tchividjian-part-1.html">Boz Tchividjian,</a> who has been dealing with addressing sexual abuse in evangelical churches for years. Evangelicals are waking up to a blaring alarm and a house ablaze.)</p>

<p>Painful as this moment is, the church needs to experience it. The evangelical church needs to lament the harm done to its members and take a long, hard look in the mirror.</p>

<p>And the evangelical church needs to repent of the patriarchy and misogyny that have lodged in the church under cover of faithfulness to scripture.</p>

<p>Some, like Al Mohler and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/05/22/amid-a-southern-baptist-scandal-some-evangelical-women-say-the-bibles-gender-roles-are-being-distorted-to-promote-sexism/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e32f6700e29e">Denny Burk,</a> believe that they can retain complementarian theology — theology that separates men and women into different roles and further both requires women to submit to their husbands and forbids women from leadership roles in the church. Some still believe that an abusive husband or dismissive pastor fails to <em>truly</em> apply complementarian theology, and thus represents individual failure rather than a flawed theology.</p>

<p>But no theology that diminishes the full humanity of any person can ever be healthy. Although most complementarians would assert that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, they are certainly not treated as equal in the eyes of the church. This is the failure of complementarian theology: the failure to treat women as beloved children of God just like men.</p>

<p>The problem is not a few bad apples. Better training and a commitment to actually report assault to the police are good and necessary; pastors must have a strong understanding of abuse dynamics so that they do not send spouses into dangerous situations in the hope that one martyred life will bring another to repentance.</p>

<p>But these actions will fail if the root cause remains unaddressed.</p>

<p>Misogyny and patriarchy are some of the oldest sins, according to the creation narrative in Genesis. Part of Eve&rsquo;s curse is that her husband will rule over her: patriarchy is rooted in the curse, along with pain in childbearing and in our work.</p>

<p>Jesus firmly rejects this patriarchy. He invites Mary to learn at his feet. He saves the woman accused of adultery from a painful death. He engages with the Samaritan woman at the well, heals the child of the Syrophoenician woman, performs his first miracle at the request of his mother. He entrusts the news of the resurrection to Mary Magdalene.</p>

<p>Paul writes that Christ erases the social and value distinctions between women and men. He works alongside women to spread the gospel. He exhorts men to lay down their privilege, enshrined by Roman law, and treat their wives as co-heirs with them, treat their wives as Christ treated the church.</p>

<p>Patriarchy remains entrenched in most cultures around the world, although certainly modern American women suffer far less than their grandmothers or their sisters in other parts of the world. But the church should set an example by addressing and rooting out the sin of patriarchy when it emerges.</p>

<p>So I hope that as the SBC and the broader evangelical church reckon with their #MeToo moment that they will awaken to the gravity of the sin of patriarchy. I pray that we as Christians will work against our culture and against our sinfulness to see women as fully human, fully created in the image of God, fully able to pursue their callings and use their gifts.</p>

<p>May this moment be not just a PR disaster but a true beginning of lament, repentance, and the humility required to lay aside the benefits of patriarchy and allow women to be as equal in the church as they are in the eyes of God.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Arthurian Tropes, Nostalgia and Hope</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>
<img src="/assets/blog_images/the_librarians.jpg" alt="The Librarians" />

</figure></p>

<p>To unwind from the stresses of moving, my husband and I have been binge-watching <em>The Librarians.</em> The series continues on from the three movies of the same name, starring Noah Wylie as Flynn Carson, aka The Librarian — think a slightly dorky Indiana Jones who collects artifacts to protect the world from dangerous magic. The show, like the movies, has so much heart that the cheesiness is adorable.</p>

<p><em>The Librarians</em>, although set in world where magic is real, completely skips the grittiness that permeates (or infests, depending on your point of view) so much television fantasy. The stories end well; good triumphs; someone can always read the ancient, faded writing in a dead language and solve the problem within 50 minutes.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s feel-good fantasy where nerds are the real heroes, and I love it.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s also a show with numerous references to the Arthurian legend, which means that when I watch it I can&rsquo;t help but activate the academic part of my brain. After all, I spent years of my life reading, researching, analyzing and writing about Arthurian narratives, both medieval and modern.</p>

<p>While <em>The Librarians</em> deploys Arthurian elements rather haphazardly, its use of these tropes resonates with the nostalgia that has always been a part of the Arthurian legend. The stories of Arthur and his kingdom are always stories of a past imagined as better, purer, more noble than the future — a golden age of chivalry lost to the present, whether that present is the twelfth century or the fifteenth or the twenty-first.</p>

<p>But in this show, the nostalgia isn&rsquo;t just wistful; it&rsquo;s also hopeful. Take Galahad, the grail knight <em>par excellence</em> of medieval stories and a major character in <em>The Librarians.</em> In the show he does not seek the grail, but as in the grail legends he remains an idealist dedicated to high moral standards. He makes the world better by simply living, but also, crucially, by training the new librarians. Galahad is a tangible reminder of a better past who provides hope for a better future.</p>

<p>The past that Galahad represents is, of course, fictional: not just made rosy by historical distance, but actually fictional, since Galahad has no possible real-life counterpart.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> And yet the nostalgia for a better, if fictional, past still works in the show to inspire a better future for the characters and, by extension, for us the viewers.</p>

<p>I admit that I sometimes can be cranky about nostalgic, romanticized views of the past — and especially the medieval past. Chivalry is violent and patriarchal; nobility depends on the oppression of the non-noble; and one has only to read Chaucer or Boccaccio to realize that medieval people were not somehow more moral than modern people.</p>

<p>And yet I fall for the combination of nostalgia and hope in <em>The Librarians</em> every time. I think it&rsquo;s because the nostalgia is not for a time period, but for a set of values that transcend time. In the show, Galahad, Excalibur, and even the Lady of the Lake stand for loyalty, courage, perseverance, knowledge and self-sacrifice. And when the cast of the show faces an enemy from the Arthurian narrative, the idea conveyed is that evil has always existed but can always be overcome by good.</p>

<p>The nostalgia for the past is transmuted into hope for the future through these transcendent values. And this alchemic process gives <em>The Librarians</em> its big, nerdy heart. Even when the odds look bleak, the values of human knowledge and human courage can still save the day.</p>

<p>Is <em>The Librarians</em> great television? Not really, to be honest. We live in a golden age of television, and many shows have better acting, effects and scripts. But the heart and the hope in this show point toward the power of ideals, a power that stretches through history to inspire us to be better versions of ourselves.</p>

<p>Arthur may have been a historical person; the knights Gawain, Kay, Bedevere and Mordred are connected with Arthur from nearly the earliest written references, although it&rsquo;s impossible to know if they are rooted in real people.

            <title>Life, Spirit and Pentecost</title>

<p>I have a confession: I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what to do with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>I mean, I believe in the Holy Spirit. I&rsquo;m just not quite sure how this third person of the Trinity fits into my paradigm of faith. The branch of evangelicalism that shaped my childhood was cessationist, and cessationism holds that the gifts of the Holy Spirit — and particularly miracles, tongues and prophecy — were limited to the apostolic age and do not continue in the church today.</p>

<p>Although cessationists are fully orthodox and affirm the Trinity, in my experience this theology tends to diminish the role and importance of the Holy Spirit. The spirit becomes the odd member out of the Trinity, not embodied like Jesus or clearly defined like God the Father and, without the spiritual gifts, seemingly mostly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been cessationist for a long time; the Anglican Church in North America, my faith tradition for more than a decade now, has strong connections to charismatic movements and fully affirms the presence of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And yet I still am uncomfortable with the Spirit. However, the great thing about liturgy is that, like it or not, we encounter the basic doctrines of the church over the course of the lectionary and the church year.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the feast of Pentecost, the culmination of the liturgical season of Eastertide and the celebration of the gift of the Holy Spirit. Churchgoers wear red, orange and yellow while the altar and vestments change from celebratory white to fiery red to symbolize <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2&amp;version=NIV">the flames dancing over the heads of the disciples</a>.</p>

<p>Weird, right? Rushing wind, dancing flames, speaking in tongues: it&rsquo;s like something out of a fantasy novel.</p>

<p>But as my priest <a href="https://friendsofthesavior.org/sermons/a-preview-of-coming-attraction-kevin-miller">preached on the Holy Spirit,</a> he focused on the Spirit as the guarantee and foretaste of our coming resurrection life in Christ. Over at least the last decade, I&rsquo;ve grown to see the beauty of the resurrection and the glory of the promise that all will one day be made whole in Christ. But I&rsquo;d never made the connection between the Holy Spirit and this work before.</p>

<p>My priest&rsquo;s sermon dovetailed with the book I&rsquo;ve been reading by Jürgen Moltmann, <em>The Spirit of Life.</em> In this book, Moltmann talks about the Holy Spirit as the spirit of life, the spirit through whom we have life in all its forms, from creation to new life in Christ. And if the Spirit is creating new life in us, then part of that new life may involve the gifts and promptings and even miraculous interventions of the Spirit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to relate to the Spirit myself. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of undeniable encounters with the Spirit in the last year that I&rsquo;m still working to understand, and that I&rsquo;m still uncomfortable with on some level. But this framework of the Spirit as a spirit of life, as a guarantee and preview of the already-but-not-yet kingdom of heaven, creates a space for the spirit to work.</p>

<p>As long as I don&rsquo;t have to <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2018/4/19/tongues">speak in tongues.</a></p>]]></description>

            <title>Women in Christianity: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</title>

<p><em>Ungrateful, she who does not love you,</em></p>

<p><em>yet she who does you judge unchaste.</em></p>

<p><em>You men are such a foolish breed,</em></p>

<p><em>appraising with a faulty rule,</em></p>

<p><em>the first you charge with being cruel,</em></p>

<p><em>the second, easy, you decree.</em></p>

<p>These lines could have been written today, especially in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/canada/toronto-van-rampage.html">recent violent attack of a Canadian man</a> furious over &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; women who wouldn&rsquo;t date him. But they were written by a Mexican nun, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, in the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Sor Juana is a well-known figure in Mexico, but I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of her until a colleague recommended that we add her to the syllabus in the humanities course that I used to teach. She certainly deserves wider recognition in the English-speaking world, both for her literary works and for her engagement in theology.</p>

<p>Sor Juana was a child prodigy who learned to read at the age of 3 and, at 12, begged her mother to allow her to dress as a boy and travel to Mexico City to study (her mother refused). She did end up in Mexico City, however, as a lady-in-waiting in a noble Spanish family. There, she continued her education and quickly gained admiration for her intelligence. Although she received several marriage offers, she chose instead to join a convent.</p>

<p>Becoming a nun meant that Sor Juana could pursue her studies without the obligations of running a household or the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth. In the seventeenth century, a convent was the best option for a woman who wanted to engage in academic and intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>And yet entering holy orders brought Sor Juana a whole new set of challenges: those who did not believe that women should engage in theological study.</p>

<p>(As much as I wish this had changed, in just the last six months John Piper has sparked controversy by claiming that <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-john-pipers-words-should-grieve-men-too">women should not teach seminary</a> and <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore has recounted the hostility</a> she faced during her brief stint in seminary. Much of the same resistance to women in theology remains today.)</p>

<p>This is where Sor Juana becomes an important figure in Christian history, and not just a brilliant young woman whose contributions to Spanish Golden Age literature earned her the title &ldquo;The Tenth Muse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1690, Sor Juana waded into a decades-long theological debate about divine acts of love towards humanity. At the request of a bishop, Sor Juana wrote down her critique of a particular Spanish theologian; this text, the <em>Athenagoric Letter,</em> circulated privately for a while, but soon the bishop published the essay without Sor Juana&rsquo;s knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>A brief side note on publishing while female is necessary to understand the reaction that ensued: in the seventeenth century, notions of decorum and propriety barred women from engaging in the public sphere. These ideas excluded women from politics and also made women&rsquo;s participation in any sort of public debate difficult — and publication was viewed as participation in public debates. Although Sor Juana did not choose to publish her essay, its publication meant that she nevertheless faced public censure as a woman who inappropriately and publicly critiqued a man.</p>

<p>The harshest criticism, lambasting Sor Juana for even entering the theological conversation, was written by the same bishop who published the <em>Athenagoric Letter.</em> He wrote under a female pseudonym, Sor Filotea de la Cruz, and urged Sor Juana in the strongest terms to give up her academic studies and instead devote herself to prayer — the proper work of a nun.</p>

<p>Sor Juana wrote a densely argued but passionate response to &ldquo;Sor Filotea&rdquo; (Sor Juana certainly knew the real identity of the author, although she plays along with the pseudonym). In her response, she argues cogently for educating women, even in theology, and for allowing them to write and teach. At one point, she asks the crucial question: &ldquo;My reason, such as it is, is it not as unfettered as his [the theologian who she argued against], as both issue from the same source?&rdquo; Although Sor Juana writes deferentially, she is keenly aware  that many of her critics would, indeed, see her as less capable of reason than a man.</p>

<p>But in her argument, she marshals support for educating women from a wide variety of authorities while building a rhetorical case that knowledge and love of God is best served by the wide-ranging knowledge gained through academic study. Sor Juana argues that understanding history, for example, helps everyone — including women — to better understand the bible.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, Sor Juana&rsquo;s response did not alleviate the mounting pressure to step away from public life and intellectual pursuits. Around 1693, she seems to have stopped writing and to have sold or given away her impressively large library, although it is unclear how willingly she did so. She spent the last years of her life in prayer and service, finally dying of the plague while caring for other sick nuns.</p>

<p>Sor Juana&rsquo;s life reminds us that, despite the many obstacles thrown in their path by patriarchy, women still know themselves to be created with the same reason as a man and still desire to turn this reason towards understanding the world and understanding God. But her death demonstrates that patriarchy can finally wear down even the most brilliant and passionate women.</p>

<p>Women in the western world today undoubtedly face fewer obstacles than Sor Juana. But the church in particular should take sober note of her story and work to encourage the gifts of all people, including women.</p>]]></description>

<p>I&rsquo;m back!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/01/01-08-2018-2017-reflections">January,</a> I chose a word for the year: space. I promised to give myself space to process, space to be in progress, space to be messy and imperfect and uncertain. Even space to take two weeks off blogging while I move to a new house.</p>

<p>I do have an actual space in my new house, though: an office just for me. Even though half the house is still a mess, my books are lined up behind me and I have my own desk and my own cozy chair and my own window. A room of my own, which is making me very happy.</p>

<p>Moving may be the worst — I hate the total chaos and disruption — but I&rsquo;m also very happy to be in a place where we&rsquo;ll stay for a while. I want to put down roots and grow into this space, instead of feeling like I can&rsquo;t take up too much space because it belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>Because, of course, giving myself space also means taking space, acknowledging that I can have the room to take deep breaths and to be honest about what I need and want. I&rsquo;ve spent too long giving space to others without asking for space myself. An office may be a small start (and to be honest, my husband had to push me to take it), but it&rsquo;s a wonderful start so far.</p>

<p>And thinking of starts and spaces, I also started a part-time job at my church as Coordinator of Children&rsquo;s Ministries. Anyone who knows me may be slightly puzzled, and it&rsquo;s certainly true that children&rsquo;s ministry has never been my passion. But as I&rsquo;m taking space to figure out my life post-academia, this opportunity for ministry has dropped into my lap, and I&rsquo;m excited to move from informal and volunteer service in my church to actually being on church staff.</p>

<p>(As a side note: I&rsquo;ve been bothered for quite a while that the only position for women on many church staffs is in children&rsquo;s ministry, so it&rsquo;s pretty ironic that this is where I&rsquo;m starting. But I&rsquo;m blessed to be in a church with women in a variety of leadership positions, including assistant rector; this job is far more likely to be a starting point in ministry than an ending one for me.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also just happy to be working again, even if it&rsquo;s only a few hours a week. Writing is great, and I&rsquo;ve been happy to be around more for my girls, but I&rsquo;ve missed being part of a bigger organization. I miss sharing ideas with and being challenged by others who share my passions, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to having that type of work community once again.</p>

<p>Springtime has finally arrived, with a new house and a new job, with literal and metaphorical space to explore new directions and to grow in my family, community and church. I&rsquo;m excited to see where this growth will take me even as I practice giving myself the space to grow.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Guest Post on CBE: Response to Paige Patterson</title>

<p>I&rsquo;m back! I&rsquo;ll have a short life update on Thursday, but today I have a guest post up at CBE International responding to Paige Patterson&rsquo;s recent remarks about abuse and marriage:</p>

<hr />

<p>Last week, an audio tape from 2000 resurfaced in which Paige Patterson, currently the president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a prominent leader in the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), described counseling women to remain in abusive marriages.</p>

<p>The unfolding reckoning within the SBC is, on the surface, about a man who was moved by the suffering of a woman—in that Patterson likely does want to see abuse end. But sadly, his advice and his theology only perpetuate the devaluation of women and further endanger them. His response falls far short because it focuses only on the man and sidelines the needs, health, and safety of the woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://swbts.edu/news/releases/press-release-paige-patterson/">Patterson’s official statement</a> about this tape, and <a href="http://bpnews.net/50802/patterson-clarifies-domestic-violence-stance">in his interview</a> with Baptist Press News, he claims that he condemns abuse. But his words in his interview demonstrate a profound lack of concern about the suffering of women; he says, “‘minor non-injurious abuse which happens in so many marriages’—and which does not make the wife fear for her safety—might spur a woman to ‘pray [her husband] through this’ rather than leave.”</p>

<p>To be crystal clear, Patterson is suggesting that women should endure abuse because if they stay and suffer, they may be able to help their husbands become better people&hellip; .</p>

<p>So I tend to be a tiny bit over ambitious at times.</p>

<p>I also indulge in ironic understatements. I’ll leave it to you, dear reader, to consider how the two may be related.</p>

<p>Anyway. I have been trying to convince myself for the last few weeks that I actually can feed, clothe and occasionally bathe three small people; do a freelance project; apply and interview for a job at my church; lead a Girl Scout troop; move into a new house; and write two blog posts per week while also at least occasionally saying hello to my husband and, if I&rsquo;m lucky, sleeping.</p>

<p>But I’m once again getting my periodic reminder that I am not, in fact, either superhuman or in possession of a time turner. And since this blog neither whines at me, pays me, or operates on a definite timeline, I think it’s the thing that has to go for the next two weeks. I’m disappointed that I don’t get to write about Sor Juana and Tamar until next month, but unlike my truck rental they can wait.</p>

<p>I will be back to my normal posting schedule on May 7. I have it on good authority that the internet will still be around when I come back.</p>

<p>(Also? I’m writing this on my phone while waiting for one of my daughters to finish ballet, and I thoroughly hate it. I feel old now.)</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Experience of Preaching</title>

<p>Two weeks ago, I did something I&rsquo;ve never done before: with a roiling stomach and a slight quiver in my knees, I walked to the pulpit in my church to preach a sermon.</p>

<p>When my priest asked me back in January if I&rsquo;d be willing to preach, I jumped at the chance. I enjoy public speaking and I&rsquo;ve missed lecturing to the humanities students once a month, as I did at my academic job. And since we use the lectionary, I had an assigned passage already and no need to worry about coming up with a topic.</p>

<p>But despite my initial excitement, I was blindsided by my own emotional reaction to preaching.</p>

<p>I heard a woman preach for the first time less than a year ago. And despite believing in and supporting women preaching for at least the last ten years of my life, those previous twenty-five years of believing that women shouldn&rsquo;t preach still linger in my soul. And so I was overwhelmed with uncertainty, doubt and feelings of unworthiness as I began to prepare my sermon.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter that I affirm and argue for and write about women preaching. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve been writing regularly for Christians for Biblical Equality. It didn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;ve led several adult Sunday School classes. Something about stepping into the pulpit brought out all of my insecurity. I could, and do, argue that women, in general, should preach. But what about when &ldquo;women&rdquo; meant me, specifically? Could I do this? Could I preach?</p>

<p>I was, either ironically or appropriately, preaching on the story of Thomas and his doubts, from John 20. My central point was that Jesus meets us in our doubts, drawing us out of those doubts and into himself. I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced periods of doubt about my faith, especially when my critical thinking turns into cynical thinking. But now I was drowning in doubt about my <em>worthiness</em> to preach.</p>

<p>And I want to be clear that my insecurity was about my intrinsic <em>worthiness</em> to preach, my status in the eyes of God. I never doubted my skills in studying a text, preparing a message, and speaking to the church. I&rsquo;m actually pretty good at all of that, and after fourteen years of teaching I have plenty of experience in prepping, teaching and speaking. So I never felt unsure about my skill or my talent; the doubt went much deeper, to the question of whether I as a woman could serve God and the church by preaching — whether God wanted that kind of service from me.</p>

<p>And so, I felt weirdly divided: I thoroughly enjoyed prepping the sermon, but I felt existential anxiety every time I thought about actually preaching it.</p>

<p>Then came Holy Week. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting, honestly, to meet God in any deep way; the previous month had been busy and stressful and not incredibly conducive to cultivating spiritual openness for the greatest feast of the Christian year. And yet, kneeling at the foot of the cross on Good Friday to pray, I knew exactly what I needed to leave there at the cross, what I needed Jesus to take up for me: my feelings of unworthiness.</p>

<p>Much to my amazement, Jesus did take them from me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not much of one for spiritual experiences; I tend to be much more cerebral than emotional, and I&rsquo;m still not entirely comfortable with that strange and mysterious third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. But I experienced an otherwise inexplicable emotional relief that Friday night at the cross. The burden and shame of my unworthiness as a woman disappeared.</p>

<p>I was still nervous the next week when I got up to preach. This was a new audience, and they didn&rsquo;t need to pay attention in order to get a passing grade on an exam. And I certainly felt the weight of preaching: getting something wrong about Shakespeare probably won&rsquo;t affect a student&rsquo;s entire life, but getting something wrong about Jesus might hurt one of my listeners. And yet I no longer felt unworthy as a woman; I felt beloved by God and supported by my church community.</p>

<p>And I even enjoyed myself, stretching muscles that I hadn&rsquo;t used in a while.</p>

<p>I hope that I&rsquo;ll be able to preach again. I imagine that I&rsquo;ll still feel doubt and uncertainty and I&rsquo;ll still wonder whether God is really calling me, specifically. But Jesus meets us in our doubts and calls us to serve him; how can I respond better than with Thomas' affirmation, &ldquo;My lord and my God&rdquo;?</p>

            <title>Snowy April: Reflections on Mind, Heart and Poetry</title>

<p><em>I started writing this post a week ago, to go up on the 12th — then I spent the weekend at the Festival of Faith and Writing and didn&rsquo;t actually post anything. I assumed I&rsquo;d have to rework the beginning because it&rsquo;s April and it should be spring … but I woke up to snow on the ground yesterday so Henryson&rsquo;s April is still much closer to my reality than Chaucer&rsquo;s!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the opening to Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>Canterbury Tales,</em> with the sweet showers of April bringing life and energy to places and people parched by the drought of winter. Actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how my April has made me want to huddle indoors, by a fire, rather than venturing out on any sort of pilgrimage (even just to the grocery store). I feel much more like the narrator of Robert Henryson&rsquo;s <em>Testament of Cresseid,</em> who ventures outside on an April night in Scotland to watch Venus rise, but is defeated by the whistling north wind and returns indoors to thaw by his fire.</p>

<p>I try to bolster myself during this long, cold spring with thoughts of superiority; after all, <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/byron/don-juan/1/">as Byron asserts,</a> &ldquo;Happy the nations of the moral north!&rdquo; But then I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with the assertion that northern people (that is, Europeans) are morally superior to other people groups, even if Byron with his notorious lack of morality certainly meant this line as a sly joke. So I turn to <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44428/the-negro-speaks-of-rivers">Langston Hughes</a> for an antidote, with his soul grown deep like a wide, warm river.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the power of poetry last week, when I spent twenty minutes reading poems to a group of first grade students (including one of my daughters). <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">&ldquo;Hope is the thing with feathers&rdquo;</a> lost them, sadly, although Dickinson is never my favorite so I secretly sympathize. But they loved <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58421/on-paper">&ldquo;on paper&rdquo; by Jacqueline Woodson</a> and they giggled through William Carlos Williams' <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say">&ldquo;This is Just to Say.&rdquo;</a> Perhaps best of all, they were amazed that Billy Collins would write a poem about <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55737/cheerios">Cheerios,</a> which is humorous enough to capture a first-grader but hooks us adults with its meditation on age and aging and time.</p>

<p>When I taught English classes, I read poetry regularly. I read poems from Homer and Sappho; Dante, Chaucer, and Marie de France; Donne, Herbert, Mary Sidney, and Milton. I even, occasionally, ventured into more modern poetry. But since leaving my teaching job nearly a year ago, I&rsquo;ve read much less poetry. I have at least one prose novel going all the time (often more), but as I was searching for poems to bring to my daughter&rsquo;s class I realized how much I miss reading poetry.</p>

<p>Poetry has an evocative and emotional power that often evades prose, even the most lyrical and powerful prose. All writers must wrestle with words, striving to convey ideas and emotions to their readers. But the poet must be sensitive to the meaning of the words and their sounds, the ideas and the rhythms conveyed by each word. But the very best poems do this in a way that bypasses our head and goes straight to our heart.</p>

<p>Even the most intellectual of poets, like John Donne or T.S. Eliot, offer a depth beyond intellectual puzzles and learned allusions. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44107/holy-sonnets-death-be-not-proud">Donne&rsquo;s Holy Sonnet 10</a> contains a brief argument against the power of death, but the poem&rsquo;s punch comes not in its logic but its resounding final lines: &ldquo;One short sleep past, we wake eternally / And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.&rdquo; The weight and finality of the heavy syllables in the last line underscore emotionally the truth that death will indeed die.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why the Bible contains so much poetry. The Psalms, of course, but also various songs and hymns are preserved throughout scripture. Rhythm and music help people remember, especially crucial in largely illiterate cultures; but this memory goes beyond intellect to embed itself in the soul as poetry links mind and emotion.</p>

<p>I have, at times, wished that the bible were more like a guidebook, or perhaps a systematic theology. But we are more than our minds; we are our bodies and our emotions and our communities. God wants to reach us in every aspect of our being, and so in addition to Paul we have the parable of Jesus; in addition to the chronicles of the kings we have psalms; and the whole of scripture is framed by poems about creation and new creation.</p>

<p>So this month, in celebration of poetry, curl up by the fire (or if you&rsquo;re lucky, find a pleasant park bench) and read a poem. Read a psalm, or Mary&rsquo;s magnificat, or Miriam&rsquo;s song; read John Donne or George Herbert or Mary Sidney or, for a giggle, <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43639/the-disappointment">Aphra Behn&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Disappointment.&rdquo;</a> Find a new poet or revisit an old friend, and engage your mind and your heart.</p>]]></description>

<p>Most parents experience at least a twinge of emotion as they send their child off to kindergarten: that first day of school marks a significant transition. I certainly felt that twinge when I dropped my oldest off for the first time. But for me, the twinge was heightened by the fact that I wasn’t just sending my daughter into a new experience for her; I was entering a new experience myself.</p>

<p>You see, I was homeschooled. About six weeks into first grade at a public school, my parents pulled me out. They meant it as a short-term solution, but my younger siblings and I ended up homeschooled through our high school graduations. And we became, gradually, the sort of homeschooling family that views public schools as evil, hotbeds of liberal politics and myriad vices.</p>

<p>So how did I end up sending my own children to public schools? …</p>

<p>I have a few things I want to say to April in the Chicagoland area: seriously? Wintry mix that is actually huge fluffy snowflakes all afternoon? Highs in the 30s? Where is my spring? I DEMAND SPRING. I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the south and I want to wear my Tevas, not my parka.</p>

<p>Ahem. Some thoughts and updates to start off the month:</p>

<p><strong>Moving!</strong></p>

<p>We bought a new house (yay!) and after assembling countless Ikea bookshelves I am ready to start unpacking my books. The vast majority of them have been boxed up for the last year, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get them out. We won&rsquo;t move all the way in for a few weeks yet, which gives us some time to paint and do cosmetic work on the house and, most importantly, set up the bookshelves.</p>

<p>(Also, I&rsquo;m pleased to report that my marriage survived both a trip to Ikea and assembling Ikea furniture. Life achievement unlocked.)</p>

<p><strong>Whole30:</strong></p>

<p>March was also my Whole30 month. It ended up being more like a Whole24, and I added legumes back in about halfway through. I decided when I began that I wasn&rsquo;t going to stress about &ldquo;compliance,&rdquo; making sure that no forbidden food passed my lips. So I definitely ate some dairy (blue cheese crumbles on my Chick-fil-A salad) and sugar (in my Panera salad dressing), but for the most part I avoided dairy, sugar and grains.</p>

<p>The Whole30 program hits my perfectionist buttons with its philosophy that you have to do it <em>perfectly</em> or start the whole program over, but I gave myself permission from the beginning to not be perfect. I tend to strive for perfection then give up in frustration when I&rsquo;m not perfect, so I knew that if I wanted to actually reset my eating habits I needed to give myself some room to fail.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m pleased to say that Whole30 (err, Whole24) was overall a good experience. I don&rsquo;t intend to keep up with the restrictions, or move towards a paleo diet, but it was good to remind myself that I can survive without sugary carbs. I found a fantastic new pork roast recipe, I reincorporated more veggies in my diet, and I discovered that cashew butter is <em>really good.</em> So I&rsquo;m counting it as a success (and very much enjoying my hot cross buns and chocolate Easter cake this week).</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong></p>

<p>I finished <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen</em> (Drew G.I. Hart), and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in racism in the church. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy read, but it is an important one. I also finished <em>Opting Out: Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home</em> (Pamela Stone). Stone examines the reasons why high-achieving women quit prestigious careers when they have children, and while her research certainly lined up with my own experience it made me angry all over again that even supposedly family-friendly workplaces do so little to support women (or men) to balance the demands of family and job, which pushes families into traditional gender roles even when that&rsquo;s not really what they want.</p>

<p>In fiction, I just finished Marie Lu&rsquo;s <em>Warcross.</em> One of the blurbs compared it to <em>Neuromancer,</em> and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite right; Lu crafts a compelling story, but her writing isn&rsquo;t quite on the level of Gibson. But I do think it&rsquo;s fair to compare it, and compare it favorably, to Ernest Cline&rsquo;s <em>Ready Player One.</em> Both feature a young protagonist unexpectedly caught up in a computer game with far-reaching global consequences, but I found Lu&rsquo;s world and characters more vivid than Cline&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also slowly making my way through <em>Gilead,</em> by Marilynne Robinson; I&rsquo;ve been putting of her novels for inscrutable reasons, but I am enjoying slowly taking in her gorgeous prose. And I&rsquo;m still working on Jürgen Moltmann&rsquo;s <em>The Spirit of Life</em>, and it is still rocking my world. I&rsquo;ve never had a good understanding of the Holy Spirit, and Moltmann is giving me so many new ways to think about this third person of the Trinity.</p>

<p><strong>Coming up:</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning a post on Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz for my women in Christianity series, and one on Tamar for stories of subversion in scripture. Also, this is April, both national poetry month and the month when medievalists celebrate ancient languages — so expect something on medieval poetry.</p>

<p>On Monday next week, I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://erinwasinger.com/blog-2/">Erin Wasinger&rsquo;s blog</a> with a piece for her &ldquo;Passing Notes&rdquo; series on choosing public schools — come for my piece and stay for the rest of series, which is great! And if you missed it, I wrote about six influential medieval women for the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/6-medieval-women-who-shaped-christian-theology">CBE blog Arise.</a></p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Maundy Thursday.</strong></p>

<p>An older couple, shuffling steps, bent backs, leaning heavily on canes. Helped by others as they kneel to wash each others feet. Love so beautiful it takes my breath away.</p>

<p><strong>Good Friday.</strong></p>

<p>Bricks clang and thud as they land at the foot of the cross, the weight of sin and shame made tangible. The wood of the cross rough beneath my palm as I kneel to pray. Can I give my bricks over to Jesus? Do I dare place them on the Son of God? But can I carry them myself?</p>

<p>It is finished.</p>

<p>Weightlessness.</p>

<p><strong>Easter Vigil.</strong></p>

<p>Cross veiled, altar bare. We hear the long story of salvation: Creation. Abraham and Isaac. The Israelites saved through the Red Sea. Dry bones taking on flesh, breathing again. My daughter dancing in the dark.</p>

<p>And then: lights, bells, deafening alleluias, flowers everywhere, the veil removed. Mary Magdalene meeting the risen Christ. My daughters twirling down the aisle, flowers in their hair, ribbons in their hands. I join them.</p>

<p>It is dark outside. But He is Risen.</p>

<p><strong>Easter.</strong></p>

<p>Banners, flowers, bells, gold and white. Loud alleluias. Joy. Jesus calls Mary by name.</p>

<p>He knows my name.</p>

<p>He is risen indeed.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Subversion in Scripture: Intro to a New Recurring Series</title>

<p>Alongside my recurring series on women in Christianity, today I&rsquo;m launching a second recurring series on subversion in scripture. I will certainly feature women in this series, although the focus will be broader, considering the many times when the stories in the bible take an unexpected turn that undermines our expectations about power and authority.</p>

<p>So why this topic? Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about the meshing of American evangelical Christianity and political power. I&rsquo;ve also, in my professional life, read and taught extensively about the meshing of religious and political power in medieval and early modern Europe — a meshing found in both the Catholic church and most Protestant sects.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In my experience, American Christians are quick to condemn, say, medieval Catholicism for intertwining religion and politics. But the notion of a separate church and state is very new in the arc of human history: only for the last three hundred years, or less, have some societies seen this separation as desirable. Denying this history seems to blind us to the reality that in America we seldom fully separate religious and civil authority.</p>

<p>And the 2016 election has brought the embrace of political power in the church into sharp relief. Donald Trump, with his series of wives and marital infidelities, his crude language, his racism, his sexism, his narcissism, does not even remotely seem like a candidate that Christians would support. And yet white protestant Christians did, in droves. And <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/26/despite-porn-stars-and-playboy-models-white-evangelicals-arent-rejecting-trump-this-is-why/">recent research</a> shows a strong connection between Christian nationalism and voting for Trump — that is, Christians voted for him because they thought he was, despite his personal failings, the candidate most likely to protect Christianity in America.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So how can American Christians claim faith in Jesus — who was executed by state power — and then put their practical trust in someone like Trump?</p>

<p>I think that we, as is typical for human beings throughout history, have forgotten that the weak things of the world will overcome the strong, that the wisdom of the wise is foolishness in the face of Christ. We place our trust in rulers and authorities, forgetting that Christ overcame all of them by humbling himself to not only become human but to live, suffer and die as a human.</p>

<p>White American Christians live the life of the wealthy, the privileged, the colonizing rather than the colonized. We forget that the comfort and power we enjoy would have been foreign to Jesus or Paul. Because we are used to power, we believe that it should save and protect us. But in our concern to protect ourselves, we seldom examine how that power oppresses others.</p>

<p>We the Romans and the Pharisees.</p>

<p>I want to be clear: I am not advocating for Christians to remove themselves from governments or other institutions or the public sphere more generally. Involvement in society at all levels is, in my view, a good thing for Christians.</p>

<p>However, we must stop placing our trust in the powers of this world, or more specifically, in controlling and sharing the powers of this world.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> We especially must stop supporting those powers to the detriment of marginalized groups. And as we do this, it&rsquo;s worth re-examining scripture with an eye towards the many ways in which God uses the weak and the marginal and the outsiders instead of the powerful, indeed to humble the powerful.</p>

<p>And Holy Week is a particularly appropriate time to launch this series. For this week, we remember the most profound subversion of all: God entered the world as a poor Jewish carpenter, living and dying under the oppressive rule of the Romans. God could have blazed into the world in glory, crushing Caesar and elevating Israel to rule the world. Instead, God entered at the bottom of society as a human being, and instead of conquering, Jesus died.</p>

<p>And yet on Easter, Christ arose in glory. He hadn&rsquo;t defeated the Roman Empire, but he had done something far more profound: he defeated sin and death and evil. He instituted new life, resurrection life, that is breaking through into the world in the promise of its coming fullness.</p>

<p>What seemed weak and foolish — a marginal Jewish teacher betrayed by a friend and brutally executed by the Romans — became the most profound victory the world has ever, or will ever, see. And this was accomplished <em>through</em> and <em>for</em> the powerless and oppressed, not at their expense.</p>

<p>So let us examine scripture to recapture the reality that God does not need earthly power, nor do we. Political power can certainly be used for good. But far too often, it elevates one group over others and props up systems of injustice and oppression. When we place our hope in those systems, we miss the point of the gospel and erect an idol for ourselves.</p>

            <title>Holy Week Devotional: The Resurrection of Lazarus</title>

<p>For the season of Lent, my church put together a devotional on the theme of Jesus meeting us in our suffering. I wrote the piece below, on the passage in John that describes the resurrection of Lazarus, to include in this devotional; as Holy Week begins, it seems appropriate to include it here, on a blog about what it means to live a resurrection life.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>John 11:1-44</strong> (NIV, via <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11:1-44&amp;version=NIV">BibleGateway</a>)</p>

<p><em>Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. (This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.) So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”</em></p>

<p><em>When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through it.” Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days, and then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”</em></p>

<p><em>“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you, and yet you are going back?”</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light. It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”</em></p>

<p><em>After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.”</em></p>

<p><em>His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.” Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</em></p>

<p><em>So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</em></p>

<p><em>Then Thomas (also known as Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”</em></p>

<p><em>On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</em></p>

<p><em>“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”</em></p>

<p><em>Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</em></p>

<p><em>“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”</em></p>

<p><em>After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.” When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</em></p>

<p><em>When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</em></p>

<p><em>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. “Where have you laid him?” he asked.</em></p>

<p><em>“Come and see, Lord,” they replied.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus wept.</em></p>

<p><em>Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”</em></p>

<p><em>But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. “Take away the stone,” he said.</em></p>

<p><em>“But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.”</em></p>

<p><em>Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”</em></p>

<p><em>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.”</em></p>

<p><em>When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face.</em></p>

<p><em>Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”</em></p>

<hr />

<p>We all like stories with happy endings: the dream achieved, the family reunited, the conflict resolved. And the story of Lazarus, recorded in John 11, telegraphs its happy ending from the very beginning. In verse 4, Jesus promises that Lazarus’ illness will not end in death; in verse 14, Jesus tells the disciples that Lazarus is dead — but that Jesus will wake him up. And in verses 25-6, when Jesus comes to Lazarus’ grieving sisters, he tells Martha that he is the resurrection and the life; anyone who believes in him will not die. John leaves his readers in no doubt that the story will end triumphantly, as indeed it does when Jesus calls Lazarus out of the grave in verse 43.</p>

<p>From one angle, this story of Lazarus tells us that through Christ we will experience healing for all of our suffering, including our deaths. Our healing is not typically as dramatic as that of Lazarus, but we believe that Christ has defeated sin and death and that because of his victory we will live eternally.</p>

<p>But this triumphant reading of the story skips over the middle. After telling his disciples that he will awaken Lazarus and assuring Martha that he is the resurrection and the life, Jesus speaks to Mary, Lazarus’ other sister. Like Martha, Mary tells Jesus that her brother would still be alive had Jesus arrived earlier. But when he sees Mary’s overwhelming grief, Jesus does not immediately raise Lazarus. Instead, Jesus is so troubled that he weeps with Mary and the mourners at Lazarus’ tomb.</p>

<p>Jesus intends, from the beginning of the story, to raise Lazarus from the dead — and he does so at the end of the story. But despite this, in the middle of the story he weeps.</p>

<p>We, like Mary and Martha, live in the middle of the story. Like Mary and Martha, we believe that Jesus came to bring healing and we believe that the resurrection is coming; but also like these sisters, our faith does not remove suffering from our lives. We often want to skip this painful middle and arrive at the happy ending. But the story of Lazarus shows us that we will meet suffering in the middle and we will find Christ grieving alongside us. Grief is not a lack of faith or a loss of hope; instead, grief comes from the inevitable effects of sin and death. Even Jesus grieved when he encountered the suffering of his beloved friends.</p>

<p>As Christians, we know that our story will end in joy and life. But we hold this in tension with the pain and sorrow of the present world, and we find hope not only in the ending but in knowing that our savior walks with us through the middle.</p>]]></description>

<p>Last week, John Piper once again riled the internet by claiming that egalitarian theology and social practice was to blame for the widespread abuse that people are bringing to light in the #MeToo movement.</p>

<p>This argument is, of course, patently ridiculous. #MeToo has gained such momentum because women&rsquo;s voices reached a critical mass that could no longer be ignored and silenced — a critical mass no doubt helped along by the slowly-growing social sense that women are people, too.</p>

<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t care to spend more time responding to Piper. <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/me-too-john-piper">Rachel Held Evans</a> and <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/do-gender-roles-keep-women-safe-response-john-piper">Mimi Haddad</a>, president of Christians for Biblical Equality, both have excellent responses that I recommend if you want a point-by-point response to Piper.</p>

<p>But I do want to address the notion at the core of Piper&rsquo;s assertion, that <strong>patriarchy is good for women.</strong> This argument can be found both inside and outside the church, far beyond the reaches of Piper, and it underlies much resistance to equality between men and women.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s ask the question: is patriarchy good for women?</p>

<p>I confess, I react strongly to this question. I resent the idea that my life would be significantly better if I just deferred to men — let men run the government, the church, the home, abdicating my own ideas to follow men. And I chafe at the idea that I could only gain influence at the pleasure of men. The clichés that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world, or that behind every great man is a great woman, may have some truth. But they also reduce women to the invisible influencers, reassured of their importance but excluded from formal positions and the rooms where it happens.</p>

<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t think that patriarchy is good for women. It reduces women — reduces me — to the eternal supporting role. And then it has the nerve to tell us that this supporting role is for our own good because we couldn&rsquo;t possible handle the lead.</p>

<p>But maybe this is just me being an emotional woman, upset over something I don&rsquo;t actually understand. So let&rsquo;s think about how patriarchy has protected women throughout history:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from that pesky business of owning property. Who wants independent means of support if they can hope that their husband, son or brother will provide it?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the horror of studying the nude male body. Women artists of the Renaissance may have wanted to paint or sculpt highly prized nudes like a Michelangelo or a Donatello, but what woman wants to endure the horror of anatomy lessons?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected early modern women from the rigors of studying rhetoric. Why should women concern themselves with the art of persuasive speech, when important topics like politics are too taxing for them to contemplate?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the danger of running marathons. After all, who wants their uterus to fall out because of all that running?</p></li>
<li><p>Patriarchy has protected women from the responsibilities of leadership in the church. What woman wants to risk becoming an Eve (or worse, a Jezebel) because she thinks that she is just as much a member of the body of Christ as a man?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Patriarchy claims that it protects women. But often what it protects is not real women, with emotions and talents and passions and fascinating things to say and create, but an idealized image of womanhood. This idealized woman protected by patriarchy ought to be grateful, submissive and supportive. She certainly doesn&rsquo;t question why she must follow rather than lead. And she never attempts to upstage men by growing wealthy or leading countries or setting athletic records.</p>

<p>Women who can fit themselves into this mold of idealized womanhood do benefit from patriarchy. They often get to exert influence, bask in reflected glory, and enjoy other social benefits of fitting the ideal.</p>

<p>But they do this by denying their own talents and desires, and the influence they have depends upon the men who grant it rather than their own intelligence or effort.</p>

<p>And where does this system leave the women who do not, by choice or circumstance, fit into the idealized model of womanhood?</p>

<p>If we look at history, over and over again we see that patriarchy only protects the women it deems valuable. Poor women seldom fit this view, or sex workers; women of color rarely see the same &ldquo;protections&rdquo; that white women do. Marginalized women don&rsquo;t benefit from patriarchy because they, by their marginalized status, cannot be ideal women.</p>

<p>So a medieval knight could rape a peasant woman with no consequence. A southern slave owner could whip a black woman and still be considered chivalrous. An Alabama lawyer could assault the teenage daughter of a poor single mother and go on to have a public career as an outspoken defender of family values.</p>

<p>This is because patriarchy doesn&rsquo;t protect women. <strong>Patriarchy protects men.</strong></p>

<p>I imagine that people like John Piper would argue that sin has twisted patriarchy: it should protect women, but instead sinful men misuse it. And I&rsquo;m going to be honest: I can&rsquo;t defeat that argument, because in this view patriarchy is clearly good and any example of its problems is evidence of sin, not a problem with patriarchy. This stance is like a conspiracy theory in that any argument against it ends up twisted to support it.</p>

<p>But the multitude of ways in which patriarchy hurts people (men as well as women, although that&rsquo;s a subject for another post), points to patriarchy itself being the sin.</p>]]></description>

<p>Can we talk about <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> for a while?</p>

<p>My husband and I are re-watching the series and finding that, for the most part, it still holds up 20 years later. We last watched the series eight years ago, I think, when my oldest was a nursing baby who never slept and I still identified with Buffy, or maybe Willow in her glorious nerdiness.</p>

<p>This time around, I&rsquo;ve decided that I want to be Giles when I grow up: fond of the children, proud of what they can do and who they are becoming, but a bit exhausted by their youthful energy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still one of my favorite shows, even with some uneven episodes (don&rsquo;t do drugs, kids, or you might turn into an ugly fish monster!). The great episodes — &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; &ldquo;Becoming,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Body&rdquo; — distill our hopes and fears into poignant moments that defy simplistic resolution.</p>

<p>But watching in an era of #MeToo and #TimesUp, and after the piece written by Whedon&rsquo;s ex-wife Kai Cole about <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/joss-whedon-feminist-hypocrite-infidelity-affairs-ex-wife-kai-cole-says/">his serial infidelities</a>, I want to talk about Buffy and sex.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Specifically, I want to talk about Buffy&rsquo;s positioning as the virgin to Faith&rsquo;s whore and the many ways in which Buffy is punished for her sexuality.</p>

<p>(Major plot spoilers ahead, if that still matters after 20 years.)</p>

<p>Buffy, despite all her teenage habits that irritate her watcher Giles, is the golden slayer. Blond, bronzed, young, smart and supernaturally strong, she represents the revenge of the vapid cheerleader who dies in horror films: she&rsquo;s the one who scares the monsters. But she&rsquo;s also a good person: a good daughter, good friend,  a good person who does what she must even when it&rsquo;s hard, something firmly established with her first death in the season 1 finale.</p>

<p>But her sexuality sits uneasily alongside these other characteristics, as we see first with Angel and then even more sharply with the arrival of Faith. Most clearly, Buffy is punished for her emerging sexuality when she sleeps with Angel: he literally loses his soul and becomes evil. Buffy&rsquo;s first time results in the death of multiple people, including Giles' love interest Jenny Calendar, and ultimately requires Buffy to send Angel into a horrific demon dimension from which he may never return.</p>

<p>Talk about an abstinence-promoting message.</p>

<p>This arc with Angel/Angelus sets Buffy up as the virginal slayer who cannot express her sexuality without causing harm to those around her. And throughout season 3, as the sexual tension mounts between Buffy and Angel, Faith&rsquo;s sensuality contrasts the restraint that Buffy must show to prevent Angel from once again losing his soul. Buffy&rsquo;s ability to control her sexual desire for Angel marks her as good, even as it causes her pain and distress.</p>

<p>Faith is Buffy&rsquo;s shadow: another slayer, but one whose dark hair and wardrobe signal her separation from Buffy&rsquo;s preppy skirts and halter tops in summery tones. And beyond her fashion choices and bad-girl vibe, Faith&rsquo;s sensuality also separates her from Buffy. Faith flirts, has casual sexual encounters, and explicitly links slaying and sex. She&rsquo;s the bad girl, the opposite of Buffy in her edgy wardrobe, her questionable ethics, and her pronounced sexuality.</p>

<p>As the virgin in this virgin/whore dichotomy between the two slayers, it&rsquo;s thus not surprising that Buffy is punished for her sexuality. (I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; loosely to indicate the trope of the woman whose sexuality stays within socially-approved boundaries; in the <em>Buffyverse,</em> that means sex within a committed relationship but never with Angel.) But it&rsquo;s still a problematic dynamic.</p>

<p>This is where it gets tricky as a Christian to critique the sexual ethic in <em>Buffy:</em> I agree that sexual restraint is a good thing; I also agree that sex is an intimate activity that should take place in a loving and committed relationship. But at the same time, sexual desire is part of human nature. To punish Buffy for her sexuality suggests that there is no good way for Buffy to be a sexual being; she cannot be both the golden slayer and a woman who desires sexual intimacy in committed relationships. This tension diminishes Buffy&rsquo;s personhood.</p>

<p>If Buffy&rsquo;s relationship with Angel was the only one where she is punished for her sexuality, I would chalk it up to the inherent drama of a star-crossed romance between vampire and vampire slayer, not a reiteration of the tired virgin/whore dynamic that shames and punishes women for their sexuality.</p>

<p>But when Buffy goes off to college, her first post-Angel sexual encounter is a disaster. She falls for the soulful, smooth-talking Parker who is so, so sorry that Buffy thought they had anything more than a momentary physical connection. Certainly Parker is portrayed as a jerk — but Buffy also comes across as naive. The tone of the brief Parker arc is that guys will be seductive jerks, but Buffy should have been smart enough to see through him.</p>

<p></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And then comes Riley. Oh, Riley of the unfortunate early-aughts haircut. In some ways, Buffy&rsquo;s relationship with Riley is the first time she can be sexual without losing her standing as the virgin of the trope. Riley is a good Iowa farm-boy-turned-loyal-soldier who genuinely cares for Buffy and is a much more age- and species-appropriate match than Angel.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>Over the course of their arc, Buffy ruins Riley&rsquo;s life. Not directly. But she causes him to lose his job, his identity as a good soldier, his chance to become an enhanced super-soldier. She threatens his masculinity with her strength and with her previous relationship with Angel. She undermines his sense of self. It isn&rsquo;t all bad, of course; working for the Initiative wouldn&rsquo;t have been sustainable for Riley long-term, anyway. But she upends Riley&rsquo;s life while he barely affects hers.</p>

<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s the season 4 episode in which Buffy and Riley&rsquo;s sexual desire releases a hoard of angry, horny essences who attack a frat party. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a mistake that this episode opens with Buffy and Riley overcome with desire after a hunt and kill; like Faith, Buffy is linking slaying and sex as physically satisfying, and this leads to trouble. It&rsquo;s not a great episode anyway, and it reinforces the idea that Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous.</p>

<p><figure class="float-right">

<p></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And then Spike. I love Spike, truly; his arc is one of the best in the series. And his love for Buffy, as complicated as it is, leads to the return of his soul. But Buffy and Spike&rsquo;s season 6 relationship once again portrays Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality in a negative light.</p>

<p>After being resurrected, Buffy has a difficult time reintegrating into her old life. She starts having sex with Spike not because she loves him or wants a relationship, but because she wants to feel sometime and because he&rsquo;s someone she loathes even more than herself. They have a deeply dysfunctional relationship: it&rsquo;s violent and destructive, based on each one taking what they think they want without considering the needs of the other person. It ends with both parties hurt, physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>After this, Buffy doesn&rsquo;t have any more relationships. She ceases to be a sexual being in order to do the work required of her in season 7. Once again, we are left with the idea that Buffy&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous, distracting, damaging. Even though the sexual ethic in the <em>Buffyverse</em> allows sex within committed relationships for other characters, Buffy must be the virgin in order to be the ideal Slayer.</p>

<p>If this were a clear requirement, the show could frame it as a sacrifice, a form of monasticism, a dying to self for the good of others. But instead, Buffy is punished for her sexuality until she gives it up. This simply reinforces the notion that women&rsquo;s sexuality is dangerous and must be controlled before it destroys the world.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Part 3 of a series on feminism and Christianity. Read part 1 <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">here</a> and part 2 <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-II">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the first two parts of this series, I looked at the ways in which God&rsquo;s view of women aligns with modern-day feminism and also at the reasons why Christians are hesitant to embrace feminism. Today, I want to lay out a few of the ways in which Christians can benefit from the tools of feminism — what does feminism have to offer Christians, especially in an era of #MeToo and #ChurchToo?</p>

<p> <strong>Terminology:</strong> Feminist scholarship has developed a vocabulary for many of the issues facing women today, and understanding this vocabulary can help Christians name the obstacles that women face in churches. Naming a problem is the necessary first step in addressing it.</p>

<p>Terms like representation and tokenism give us a vocabulary for talking about whether, and where, women are involved in ministries and leadership — and whether those women actually have a voice, or are simply present to check a diversity box. Churches can certainly address issues of representation without using this vocabulary, but being able to categorize and define a problem can be useful.</p>

<p>For another example, understanding what feminists mean by &ldquo;rape culture&rdquo; (an environment that curtails a woman&rsquo;s ability to consent to sex while also encouraging men to not take no for an answer) is fundamental to fostering a healthy sexual ethic. We need to identify how unhealthy cultural ideas about women and sexuality creep into our own sexual ethics as Christians, and feminism has the vocabulary to help us think through the implications of how we talk about sex and sexuality.</p>

<p><strong>Defining patriarchy:</strong> Related to terminology, feminist thinkers have spent decades studying the ways in which patriarchy permeates society. This work is essential to locating patriarchy in the church and identifying the often overlooked, but insidious, ways in which it operates.</p>

<p>Christians, especially evangelical Christians, typically view themselves as separated from culture. This attitude, however, blinds us to the ways in which the separation is smaller than we think and the ways in which we accept certain cultural ideas without question or examination. Because patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society broadly and the church specifically, we need all the tools we can use to root this sin out of the church.</p>

<p>Additionally, understanding how patriarchy works will help us to better understand both the bible and other theological texts. Thinking carefully about how patriarchal societies view women will make the counter-cultural elevation of women by Jesus, for example, especially clear — and can also help us better understand Paul&rsquo;s writings about women in the church.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding gender:</strong> One of the sticking points in arguments within Christianity about gender roles is the creation narrative, and specifically the separate creations of Adam and Eve. Some Christians argue that this supports specifically created gender roles; other Christians stress the earlier account that mentions the creation of human beings broadly, arguing that God did not create men and women to be wholly different.</p>

<p>Some Christians may be surprised to learn that feminists have similar debates. These debates may not draw on the creation narrative in Genesis, but they boil down to the question of whether women and men are actually different in their essence, or if those differences arise from our society. The one side, the gender essentialists, understand gender as fixed, with feminine and masculine traits that are universal. The other side sees gender as socially conditioned, &ldquo;performative&rdquo; in the language of Judith Butler.</p>

<p>I personally fall firmly on the side of gender as conditioned by society. But Christians who want to argue that men and women have God-imbued differences can benefit from understanding the secular version of the argument, especially since most gender-essentialist feminists want to balance these differences between the genders with a strong affirmation of equality.</p>

<p><strong>Recovering women&rsquo;s narratives:</strong> Alongside all of the theoretical framework, feminist scholars have done us an invaluable service by recovering the contributions of women in myriad areas — literature, science, politics, philosophy, and many others — throughout history. For Christians, writers like Lynn Cohick have reminded us of the many crucial women in the church in its earliest days; others write about more contemporary women who are often overlooked in the church&rsquo;s stories of giants of the faith.</p>

<p>Feminist scholars have also recovered for the church the apostle Junia, praised by Paul as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+16:7&amp;version=NIV">great among the apostles</a> — but whose name was changed to Junias by later copyists and translators who refused to accept a woman apostle.</p>

<p>Highlighting important women in the bible and in Christian history isn&rsquo;t enough to reverse the effects of patriarchy. But if we expect the girls and women in the church to learn from the examples of a David or a Paul, why not also expect the boys and men to learn from Deborah and Priscilla? Highlighting women allows other women to see a place for themselves in the story of Christianity, but men also need to hear these stories so they can make space for, learn from, and be inspired by women.</p>

<p>Feminism and Christianity may seem opposed, but feminist thought has much to offer Christians who are committed to treating women as human beings fully created in the image of God whose gifts and callings are not limited by their gender. Let us use these analytical tools to dismantle the patriarchal sins that harm both the members of the church and its witness to the wider world.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 2 of a series on feminism and Christianity. Read part 1 <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">here</a></em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/03/christianity-and-feminism-I">Last week</a>, I wrote about how scripture displays the importance of women to God, as women are frequently honored or elevated in ways that run counter to the patriarchy of the ancient world. Since feminism is a recent movement, nothing in the bible explicitly affirms it. But feminism affirms women as the equals, not the subordinates of men, and aligns with the liberation of the oppressed that occurs so often throughout scripture.</p>

<p>Just over 200 years ago, feminism begin to arise a social movement designed to elevate and dignify women in the face of patriarchal social structures. Early feminists, like Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, primarily argued that women should be educated. They claimed that women were not naturally intellectually inferior to men; instead, they seemed inferior because they were denied the educational opportunities given to men.</p>

<p>From this modest beginning, feminism has grown and changed. Feminists have, slowly, won women in the western world the right to own property, vote, attend college, handle their own finances, and work after marriage and childbearing. Most broadly, feminists argue that men and women are equal and should be treated as equals; biological sex alone should not lead to different treatment.</p>

<p>Thanks to feminism, attitudes towards women have gradually shifted in American society. Most people no longer believe that women are too physically frail to run marathons or that higher education will make women go insane. Even in the church, only a small minority argue that women were created as inferior to men; women may be barred from certain positions, but the argument rests on roles, not female inferiority.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite the many ways in which feminism has reshaped western society over the last two centuries, American Christians — especially evangelical Christians — tend to resist feminism (and not only Christians; many people outside the church are also reluctant to identify as feminists). Why does so much opposition to feminism exist in the church? What about feminism engenders so much resistance?</p>

<p>Given the progress that feminism has made over the last century, some in the church (and beyond) no longer see feminism as necessary. From this point of view, feminism is no longer about advocating for women&rsquo;s full participation in society but instead about special treatment for women.</p>

<p>Others view feminism with suspicion because they see the tearing down of patriarchal structures as the equivalent of tearing down society or, worse, destroying the created order. It may be fine for women to vote, but when women out-earn men and take on leadership roles in churches, businesses and governments they threaten the often unquestioned and unexamined social power of men.</p>

<p>Yet another objection to feminism is its association with the sexual revolution and with abortion rights for women. Many, if not most, contemporary feminists argue that women should be freed from sexual double standards and not shamed for behavior that men engage in without censure. And many feminists do prioritize a woman&rsquo;s control over her own body, elevating the woman above her fetus.</p>

<p>For some Christians, these objections are enough to rule out the possibility of Christian feminism.</p>

<p>But I think that feminism is too valuable a movement to simply dismiss. Christian feminists will no doubt differ from their secular counterparts (and even from each other), but feminism like Christianity itself has diverse and often conflicting strands. If Christians can recognize that women still need to be freed from the bondage of patriarchy, feminism can offer the tools to help us in that work.</p>

<p>To address the first objection, that feminism is no longer necessary: feminism certainly has made progress. Discrimination on the basis of sex is no longer legal in the United States; women can vote, own property, run for public office, and open their own bank accounts. Despite legal protections, however, women still face an uphill climb in many of their endeavors. Sexual harassment and assault is distressingly common even in the workplace, as the #MeToo movement is showing; women make up only a fraction of Fortune 500 CEOs and remain under-represented in political office.</p>

<p>Feminists are still working to highlight and tear down the barriers that women face on a daily basis. These barriers vary, of course, based on other intersecting aspects of privilege (as a white, straight, educated woman I have faced fewer barriers than others). But the obstacles women face are real and if women are to participate fully in society we must do the painful work of identifying the ways in which our culture holds women back from their full potential.</p>

<p>The point above is closely related to the second. Because much of feminism is about changing cultural attitudes towards women, it can feel like a tearing down of traditional society. The painfulness of this change points to how deeply entrenched patriarchy is in our society: smashing the patriarchy means rethinking myriad assumptions and traditions about everything from how families work to who gets to speak with authority (and without interruption).</p>

<p>For Christians who see patriarchy as part of God&rsquo;s created order, feminism presents an existential threat. But if we recognize, as I believe scripture shows, that patriarchy is part of the curse and a sign of relationships disrupted by sin, then the work of feminism aligns with our work as resurrection people. Feminism is thus doing the work of combatting the effects of sin, and Christians should be the first to join in this work.</p>

<p>But the third objection, about sexual liberation and abortion, often holds Christians back from joining with feminists in this work. I can&rsquo;t fully wrestle with either topic today, but we need to remember that feminists hold a range of opinions on these topics. While some see pornography and hook-up culture as empowering, others see them as damaging to women. Both, however, want to see women enjoying their sexuality in safe and healthy ways — and while Christians may define safe and healthy in slightly different ways, our goal isn&rsquo;t actually that different.</p>

<p>Abortion is perhaps the thorniest issue, one that Christian feminists must wrestle with. And yet, few pro-choice feminists celebrate abortion; even as they fight to keep it legal, they work to support women so that they don&rsquo;t have to choose abortion. Affordable contraception, robust social services, low-cost childcare and better (much better) maternal leave policies would all make it more possible for women to have their babies. Christians should (and do) also engage in this work, modeling an approach to this issue that cares deeply for both mother and child.</p>

<p>Feminism is a complex social movement, but at its core it attempts to reverse the patriarchal social structures that keep women from reaching their full potential. If we view patriarchy as one of the oldest sins, little prevents Christians from joining the work of feminism.</p>

<p>But even if they can embrace feminism, why should Christians do so? What does feminism offer that a mere rejection of the sin of patriarchy can&rsquo;t? I will turn to that question in Thursday&rsquo;s post.</p>

<p>This argument is still incredibly problematic; while one may maintain a theoretical distinction between a person&rsquo;s appropriate roles and a person&rsquo;s value as a human being, in practicality these distinctions collapse. But it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the majority of Christians who affirm traditional gender roles do not affirm that women are inferior to men.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p><em>Part 1 of a series on feminism and Christianity.</em></p>

<p>Oil and water. Fire and ice. Feminism and Christianity.</p>

<p>One doesn&rsquo;t have to search long to find people who think that feminism and Christianity are incompatible. In certain Christian circles, feminism ranks alongside humanism and communism as a force that undermines all that is good and holy in American culture. On the other side of the coin, some feminists can&rsquo;t see how an often patriarchal and even misogynistic religion could ever mesh with their ideologies of equality and empowerment for women.</p>

<p>Those of us who are feminists and Christians can often feel caught in a double bind, having to justify both positions to those skeptical that they can, or should, ever combine.</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I will explore how Christians can learn and benefit from feminism. But before I can get to that, we have to begin with the question: can Christians be feminists?</p>

<p>My answer to that question is an unequivocal yes. I base that on two lines of reasoning: first, I believe that the word of God — embodied in both Jesus and scripture — supports the equality of women and men in worth and dignity. Second, although Christians can dismiss feminism as cultural or worldly, feminism is doing the kingdom work of bringing freedom to the oppressed. The church ignores this work at its own peril.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll be looking at support for feminism in scripture and the actions of Jesus; on Thursday, I will look at feminism as a liberating movement that works to restore the freedom and dignity to women that is so often denied by the sin of patriarchy.</p>

<p>Starting with scripture, the first thing to be clear about is that Jesus was not a feminist, nor was Paul or any other figure in the Old or New Testament. Feminism is a relatively recent movement that began by arguing, against the received wisdom of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, that women are not inferior to men by nature and advocating for women&rsquo;s education and, gradually, other rights. While various western thinkers and writers since the ancient world have viewed women in proto-feminist ways, feminism did not exist in the era of Jesus.</p>

<p>However — and this is a big however — throughout scripture women are treated with dignity and respect, often very counter-culturally. Think of Ruth, not only a woman but a foreigner, whose loyalty to her mother-in-law earns her a place in the genealogy of David and Jesus. Or Deborah, who served Israel as a judge; or Hannah, a barren second wife granted special favor by God; or Esther, who saves her people; or Rahab, or Abigail, or Hannah, or Miriam.</p>

<p>It can be easy to read the Old Testament as oppressive to women, and certainly very few in the ancient world actively challenged patriarchy. But the frequency with which women play key roles in the Old Testament, from the midwives in Egypt to the prophet Huldah, suggests that God values women and uses them to do God&rsquo;s work. Additionally, we frequently see vulnerable women being given special protection: the five <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+27:1-11&amp;version=NIV">daughters of Zelophehad</a>, who are allowed to inherit their father&rsquo;s estate, or Hagar, miraculously protected by God after Abraham sends her away.</p>

<p>And when we move to the New Testament, we see Jesus including women, like Mary and Martha; treating women with dignity, like the Samaritan woman at the well or the woman who poured perfume on his feet; healing women on the margins of society, like the woman with the discharge of blood. Women were the last at the cross and the first at the empty tomb. Jesus sends Mary Magdalene to announce the resurrection as the apostle to the apostles — especially striking given that society saw women&rsquo;s testimony as unreliable.</p>

<p>Even Paul writes that in Christ, the divisions between male and female collapse, just as the divisions between Jew and gentile, slave and free — Christ levels all social hierarchies.</p>

<p>So Jesus may not have been a feminist in the modern sense of the term. But if we read the bible with an eye to God&rsquo;s heart for the socially marginalized and disenfranchised, we find that God values women and honors them, and does not see women as inferior to men. And when the curtain in the Temple rips from top to bottom at the crucifixion, Christ throws the temple open to all, with no more divisions of any kind between worshipers.</p>

<p>Neither scripture nor Jesus require us to be feminists. But we can see that God values women and undercuts the patriarchy that oppresses them, which means that when we work to liberate women we are engaged in the subversive work of God&rsquo;s kingdom that overturns worldly hierarchies. On Thursday, we will turn to the question of whether, and how, modern-day feminism does this liberating work.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>I should note here that some Christians advocate passionately for the full inclusion of women in the church but choose not to identify as feminists. Feminism carries a lot of baggage, so I understand this decision. However, the work of these Christians on the behalf of women is inevitably connected to and shaped by modern feminism, so even those who refuse this label can benefit from understanding how the tools of feminist thought can support egalitarian theology.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>Today, a series of odds and ends and miscellaneous thoughts not developed enough for a whole post.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saw <em>Black Panther</em> last week and I loved it. At this point, I might as well just give Marvel all my entertainment money; I can&rsquo;t think of a Marvel film in the last several years that I haven&rsquo;t enjoyed. (Except maybe <em>Thor: The Dark World,</em> but even that was saved by Tom Hiddleston&rsquo;s Loki.) I especially appreciated (<strong>spoilers</strong>) that the villain, Killmonger, was not wrong about the need for Wakandans to be more active in the world and was also eminently justified in his resentment. He was a monster created in part by the failings of the dead king T'Chaka and of Wakandan society more broadly. But Killmonger was also shaped by a U.S. government that saw him as a weapon, not a person, and trained him accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking of <em>Black Panther</em> and the end of Black History Month, I&rsquo;ve been working to diversify my reading list. I&rsquo;m not looking for cookies; I definitely have a long way to go. But I&rsquo;m learning a lot about racism in the church from Drew G.I. Hart&rsquo;s <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen.</em> I&rsquo;m leading a book study for my church on <em>Gracism</em> by David Anderson, and while I have my critiques of the book (it was written pre-Obama, and feels far too optimistic for the current racial climate), it is generating good discussion. I read <em>The Salt Roads</em> by Nalo Hopkinson, a sprawling novel about African women and their bodies, their loves, their gods, their suffering, and their joys. I&rsquo;m too close to it to say much more, but it&rsquo;s one of those novels that will stick with me for a while. I&rsquo;ve just started Kwame Alexander&rsquo;s <em>Solo</em>, and I&rsquo;m delighted to read a novel in verse.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading non-fiction: one of my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions was to read more non-fiction, and I&rsquo;ve been working on it. I haven&rsquo;t actually finished any non-fiction, but I&rsquo;m reading <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen,</em> <em>The History of White People</em> (Nell Irvin Painter), <em>Opting Out: Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home,</em> (Pamela Stone), and Jürgen Moltmann&rsquo;s <em>The Spirit of Life.</em> (No, I don&rsquo;t have a problem. Ignore the teetering pile of books by my bed. I can stop reading multiple books at a time whenever I want.) <em>The Spirit of Life</em> is rocking my world right now — I have never had a good understanding of the Holy Spirit, and this book is helping me to appreciate that mysterious third member of the Trinity. Expect more on this book, and probably <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen</em>, in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m starting Whole30 today. I know, I know: it&rsquo;s a fad diet; it&rsquo;s probably not going to change my life. But I&rsquo;ve fallen into some unhealthy eating habits and after too many years of calorie counting apps and Weight Watchers, I need a reset that doesn&rsquo;t involve logging my food. It&rsquo;s not going to be fun, but hey: if Mary of Egypt can <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2018/02/mary-of-egypt">survive on three loaves of bread</a> for 47 years, I can make it through 30 days without carbs. Maybe.</p></li>
<li><p>Coming up in March, I&rsquo;m going to have a 3 (or maybe 4) part series on feminism and Christianity over the next two weeks. I will almost definitely write about <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>, because all the love for Meg Murray. And I&rsquo;m launching a new recurring series on the subversiveness of scripture. To keep up with this content, you can follow my author page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/intoresurrection/">Facebook</a> or get blog posts via Twitter @to_resurrection.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;m going to enjoy March&rsquo;s lamb-like entry this weekend and hope that old sayings won&rsquo;t come true. But if March does go out like a lion, maybe I&rsquo;ll curl up on the couch and actually finish one book before starting the next. One can, after all, dream.</p>]]></description>

<p>In this season of Lent, it seems appropriate to write about a Desert Mother from Egypt. The Desert Fathers and Mothers were early Christian monastics who, primarily after official Roman persecution of Christianity had ended, chose to live ascetically in the deserts of the Middle East (mainly Syria) and North Africa (including Egypt). Many lived as hermits, especially the men; some — particularly women — formed early monastic communities.</p>

<p>I encountered the story of Mary&rsquo;s life in an Old English version, translated from Latin in a tenth-century compilation of saints' lives; different versions have slightly different details, but the narrative remains consistent across versions. The story begins not with Mary but with a monk named Zosimus, who was raised in a monastery and who strives to live a blameless and holy life. Following the traditions of his monastery in the Holy Land, he goes out during Lent to fast for forty days alone in the wilderness. During these forty days, he finds Mary, and she recounts her life story to him.</p>

<p>From a young age, Mary tells Zosimus, she indulged the lusts of the flesh, going so far as to accompany a pilgrimage to Jerusalem because she wanted to seduce handsome young pilgrims. But when she attempted to enter a church in Jerusalem, an invisible power physically barrred her from entry. While alone in the courtyard, Mary saw an image of the Virgin Mary and was moved to repent of her sins and pray that the Virgin would intercede for her, despite her sinfulness.</p>

<p>After this prayer, Mary could enter the church where she received assurance that God will receive any who repent. She prayed to be shown the path to penitence, and was led through the Jordan River and into the desert where she lived alone for 47 years before meeting Zosimus. She miraculously survived on three loaves of bread and what she could scavenge; she also has prophetic knowledge about Zosimus and despite her illiteracy displays a supernatural understanding of scripture.</p>

<p>After telling her story to Zosimus, Mary requests that he wait for her by the Jordan River the next year with the eucharist. He does so, and she walks on water across the river to receive the sacrament from him. She then asks him to return to the place where they first met the next year; when Zosimus makes this journey, he finds Mary dead, and he buries her with the help of a friendly lion. Zosimus then tells her story to the others at his monastery so that they can learn from the life and preserve the memory of this holy woman.</p>

<p>To our modern western ears, this is a bizarre story. Mary&rsquo;s miraculous survival over nearly half a century alone in the desert, her levitation during prayer, her ability to walk on water, and her body&rsquo;s capacity to tame a wild beast strain our credulity — and in reality, a historical Mary of Egypt may have never existed.</p>

<p>In addition, Mary&rsquo;s impulse to subjugate the sinful flesh in order to purify the spirit is no longer deeply woven into the fabric of at least modern American Christianity. I would argue that the elevation of spirit over body owes more to Platonism than to the New Testament. Moreover, in this framework women&rsquo;s bodies tend to be seen as especially sinful. In Mary&rsquo;s story, the proper penitence for indulging sexual desires is the extreme denial of all fleshly desires, even needs — and it&rsquo;s the woman in the story who has sinned sexually, while the man is a virgin.</p>

<p>But at the same time, this story also shows that humility, not a sinful past or devout present or social status, is central to Christianity. Zosimus has been pure and devout since childhood, but he recognizes Mary as more holy than he despite her past. In an amusing moment in the narrative, Zosimus and Mary argue over who should bless the other; finally, Mary blesses Zosimus, indicating her higher status. Significantly, Zosimus is devout, educated, ordained, and a leader in his monastic community, in contrast to the uneducated, illiterate, and isolated Mary. Yet Zosimus sees Mary as a spiritual superior, someone who can guide him towards even greater spiritual growth.</p>

<p>Zosimus is willing to learn from Mary because he recognizes her devotion and her closeness to God — qualities that do not depend on education, status, or lifelong purity. This narrative affirms that to God, and thus to us, external markers of status or even holiness (like Zosimus&rsquo;s status as priest and abbot) are immaterial. Devotion to God matters, and that does not depend on anything other than a willingness to seek God and repent of sin.</p>

<p>Mary&rsquo;s devotion was extreme and her survival through her asceticism miraculous, and I don&rsquo;t want to suggest that the path to repentance and God lies through such extreme denial of the body. But as her story suggests, even the best among us can learn from and be inspired by Mary. The story of St. Mary of Egypt promises us that no matter what our past sins or present circumstances, God will be gracious to us.</p>

<p>Besides which, next to Mary&rsquo;s 47 years of solitude and survival on the little she could find in the desert, whatever Lenten discipline we may have chosen seems quite mild and bearable in comparison.</p>

<p>When I resigned from my academic job just over a year ago, I promised myself not to write a piece of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/09/dont-quit-your-day-job/404671/">quit</a> <a href="http://erinbartram.com/uncategorized/the-sublimated-grief-of-the-left-behind/">lit</a>,&rdquo; a genre to which many academics have contributed. Many of these articles point out the troubling realities of higher education, realities that I have seen and experienced. But the thing is, I still love academia.</p>

<p>After spending nine years in graduate school, then a year as a post-doc, it was incredibly painful to walk away. More, my PhD program, like most programs in the humanities, left me with the impression that an academic career was the only acceptable outcome of all that labor. I was leaving not just a job, not even just a career, but an identity.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t regret my PhD, or my four years as a professor. I got to immerse myself in the beautiful and bizarre literature of the middle ages. I spent my days researching, writing and teaching. I was surrounded by brilliant people who shared my passions and who helped me become a better thinker and teacher. I taught many wonderful students.</p>

<p>But for me, the good wasn&rsquo;t enough to balance out the bad. So here&rsquo;s my quit lit.</p>

<p>I quit a tenure-track job in my fourth year. I worked at a small, Christian college in a mid-size city in the south; because our teaching load was heavy and research expectations were light, I would have gone up for tenure in my fifth year. I didn&rsquo;t want to go through the time-intensive process of tenure in bad faith, knowing that I had no intention of staying, so I resigned without having landed a new position.</p>

<p>Leaving was one of the most painful, difficult decisions I&rsquo;ve made. I had some wonderful colleagues who challenged and supported me, who pointed me towards opportunities and commiserated over grading and brought me coffee and donuts. I had students who I feel privileged to have taught, the type of students who made me a better teacher.</p>

<p>But this is not a good time, economically or culturally, for second-tier small private colleges. My school, like many others, tried to remain appealing by focusing on professional and pre-professional programs. However, the administration did this while also insisting that we were still a liberal arts college, a school that valued the humanities. And I get it: a core humanities program certainly distinguished our professional degrees from those at the nearby regional state school.</p>

<p>The problem, though, was that the administration didn&rsquo;t back up their professed admiration for the humanities with any tangible actions. Instead, they cut language programs, expected faculty members to do the work of two people, and paid adjuncts so badly that it was nearly impossible to find someone to teach courses like beginning Spanish or French.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The administration&rsquo;s disregard for the work performed by faculty, and not just faculty in traditional liberal arts majors, became abundantly clear to me in the first faculty meeting what would be my last year. Our president, addressing the faculty, summarized an article he had read about the top indicators of a healthy college — and faculty didn&rsquo;t make the list at all.</p>

<p>Our president, speaking to the faculty about how wonderful our college was, <em>didn&rsquo;t mention our work</em> as part of what made the college successful.</p>

<p>That hurt. When an 18-year-old blows off my class, I chalk it up to immaturity. I couldn&rsquo;t do the same when my president disregarded my work. Or when he praised our work while making it more difficult for us to do it. Or when he froze our salaries but reminded us that, as faculty at a Christian college, we should be more concerned with the good we were doing than the money we weren&rsquo;t earning.</p>

<p>Added to that was the deeply entrenched good-old-boys culture at the school, exacerbated by the insularity of the whole region that made it incredibly difficult for an outsider — especially a female outsider — to gain influence.</p>

<p>All of these factors wore me down. I have great admiration for my colleagues who continue to fight to make things better, to provide an excellent education for our students, to create enthusiasm about humanities majors. But I didn&rsquo;t want to fight to do my job, and I didn&rsquo;t want to stay and keep my head down and hope for the best.</p>

<p>So I left. And because the academic job market is tight, to put it mildly, and because after five years of being on the academic job market I couldn&rsquo;t keep trying to land an elusive job, I left not only my college but academia. I&rsquo;m figuring out what comes next, blogging here and regrouping.</p>

<p>I called this blog <em>Into Resurrection</em> because I want to think through what it means to live into the reality of the resurrection, what it means to do the work of God&rsquo;s kingdom in this world. So I find it deeply ironic that I left a job where my purpose was to train young Christians to think carefully and critically about the world around them so that they could do kingdom work, resurrection work.</p>

<p>Leaving my job felt a little bit like death. I lost not only a job but an identity, and I&rsquo;ve been grieving that for the past year. I&rsquo;ll probably still be grieving it for a while; I imagine I&rsquo;ll feel a twinge for many more Augusts when I walk into Target and see the display with dorm room essentials.</p>

<p>But resurrection is coming. Easter is approaching, and spring; as my grief begins to clear away, I can see that this loss is not the start of endless winter but instead a fallow time before something new begins.</p>

            <title>The Death of Chivalry</title>

<p>The day after Valentine&rsquo;s Day seems like a good time to contemplate the death of chivalry, no? So settle down with your discount chocolate and let us determine whether or not we should deposit our roses upon the grave of chivalry.</p>

<p>We must begin with the fact that medieval chivalry is indeed dead. Deceased. No more. Pining for the fjords.</p>

<p>The chivalry that arose in the middle ages was a warrior code for the <em>chevalrie,</em> or mounted knights. During the middle ages, because the armored knight on horseback was both the most effective and most expensive battle technology, these elite warriors came from the class with money: the nobility. Chivalry developed as a warrior code for these noble warriors, who were a powerful but small group within medieval society.</p>

<p>There is no single code of chivalry, as chivalry existed for several centuries in multiple distinct cultural contexts across Europe. But broadly, the ideals of chivalry encompassed strength on the battlefield (prowess), good manners and wise counsel (courtesy), and devotion to God and the Church (piety).</p>

<p>Beneath these three pillars, however, the purpose of chivalry was to simultaneously <em>control</em> and <em>legitimize</em> violence. It controlled violence by setting rules about how to interact with others of the same class on the battlefield (rules that did not apply to fighters from lower classes). But it also legitimized violence by requiring that the nobility prove their chivalry through violence, preferably war but tournaments or hunting if necessary.</p>

<p>So, to recap: chivalry was a warrior code that applied to men in the medieval nobility. While chivalry included many characteristics and ideals, the one non-negotiable constant remained violence. Chivalry seems a little less romantic put this way.</p>

<p>So how did chivalry become romanticized?</p>

<p>We can blame the Romantics of the nineteenth century. After the middle ages gave way to the early modern period, chivalry morphed into the polish of the courtier and separated from warrior elites, since mounted knights became an obsolete battle technology by the end of the middle ages. Violence remained an important marker of masculinity, displayed in wars and in duels, but chivalry as a social code all but disappeared.</p>

<p>However, in the nineteenth century, the Romantics began seeking alternatives to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. They turned to the middle ages and, well, romanticized them, creating the middle ages of <em>The Idylls of the King</em> and <em>Ivanhoe</em> and innumerable pre-Raphaelite paintings of knights and ladies.</p>

<p>As imagined by writers like Alfred Tennyson and Sir Walter Scott, chivalry is no longer focused on violence practiced by a warrior elite but on virtue and courtesy. Romance takes center stage, and the central aspect of courtesy becomes courtesy to women.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Violence still plays a role as a vital part of masculinity, but the recreated chivalry of the nineteenth century interacts with idealized, fictional violence with clear divisions between good and evil.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Like medieval chivalry, however, this romanticized chivalry still applies only to men. It extends beyond noble men, and might sometimes democratically confer nobility of character upon the chivalrous man, but women are still the <em>objects</em> of chivalry, never its possessors.</p>

<p>When people discuss the death of chivalry, they mean this reimagined chivalry, a chivalry that arose in literature rather than in communities. And they imagine it has been killed by a lack of good manners in today&rsquo;s youth, or perhaps by joyless feminists, or hook-up culture, or whatever someone thinks makes the present worse than the past.</p>

<p>In other words, chivalry today is always nostalgic for an idealized past in which men were noble and women were compliant. This nostalgia erases those who could not, because of their socio-economic status, be chivalrous: people of color (too savage, for the Victorian, to be chivalrous); poor people (too unrefined to be chivalrous); or women who work (clearly not worthy objects of chivalry). The nostalgia instead elevates the desires of a certain class of men to feel noble and to demonstrate their superiority through displays of chivalry to each other and to deserving women.</p>

<p>Medieval chivalry served a social purpose, even if from our modern-day point of view we can see its limitations. Nineteenth-century chivalry was nostalgic from the start, serving an escapist purpose and creating a sense of social superiority.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>To be clear, I think that basic courtesy is an important element of society. I appreciate it when people hold doors or let someone else go first. I teach my children the courtesy phrases: thank you, excuse me, have a nice day. But these small daily courtesies can and should be practiced by anyone; they do not signal status but a basic respect for others.</p>

<p>Chivalry, by contrast, signals status and a certain self-conception, and in all of its incarnations men are the practitioners of chivalry, women its recipients. Some might argue that women benefit from chivalry, and in some limited ways that is true. But those benefits come at the cost of full participation in society and at the cost of expected passivity and constant receptiveness to chivalrous gestures, whether women want those gestures or not.</p>

<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to enumerate the problems that arise when a society expects women to be passive and powerless.</p>

<p>Chivalry isn&rsquo;t dead, but engrained in the sexism, racism and classism in American society. But maybe it is slowly dying, replaced by a more egalitarian respect between genders.</p>

<p>And when its death finally comes, I will be first in line to lay my roses on the grave of chivalry.</p>

<p>How should we understand salvation? For centuries, theologians have considered this question, proposing various soteriological models and analogies that help us grasp what Christ did on the cross and how he did it. Any model has strengths and weaknesses and more or less relevance in specific cultural contexts, but each analogy can help us to gain new insight into how Christ accomplished our salvation.</p>

<p>Among American evangelicals, the prominent — and sometimes the only — model of salvation is penal substitutionary atonement. In this model, God is a divine judge who has sentenced humans to eternal death and damnation because of their sins. However, Jesus steps in and takes that penalty upon himself, paying it so that we humans don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>This analogy for salvation arose with the Reformation, an era in which the individual became ascendant over the community and in which new legal theories arose. Penal substitutionary atonement reworked the older satisfaction model, developed by the theologian Anselm in the eleventh century. In the satisfaction analogy, God like a feudal ruler has been offended by the sinfulness of humanity, but humans are so far beneath God as to be incapable of offering satisfaction for this offense. Enter Jesus, the God-Man: as a human, he can step forward to offer satisfaction, and as God, he is actually capable of doing so.</p>

<p>Anselm&rsquo;s satisfaction theory emphasizes Christ&rsquo;s humanity, which had been less prominent in the previous dominant model, known as <em>Christus Victor</em> theology. In this analogy, Christ is a warrior who comes to rescue humanity from the devil, sin, evil and death. <em>Christus Victor</em> soteriology captures the upside-down logic of the cross, in which the battered and dying man is really the king of the world who can defeat the forces of evil and rescue his creation.</p>

</figure></p>

<p>Several other models of salvation exist, although the three described above are perhaps the most prevalent in western Christianity (I can&rsquo;t speak to the soteriology of the eastern church, unfortunately). Each model finds scriptural grounding, while also reflecting broader cultural values about leadership, laws and individuals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time outlining these ideas so that I can talk about <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/penal-substitutionary-atonement-it-doesnt-get-more-personal.html?share=">one specific article</a>, written by Mark Galli of <em>Christianity Today</em>, that defends penal substitutionary atonement as the primary soteriological model that evangelicals should use. Evangelicals have debated the place of this model for at least a decade, with some <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/penal-substitutionary-atonement-necessary/">expressing reservations</a> and others calling this model <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thoughtlife/2017/06/substitutionary-atonement-necessary-evangelical-faith/">inseparable from the gospel itself.</a> Galli holds a moderate position in this debate: while he argues that penal substitutionary atonement should be the primary evangelical model of salvation, he grants the usefulness of other soteriological theories.</p>

<p>Galli does make some flawed arguments. Several are minor, largely reflecting the pervasive evangelical blindspots towards cultural context and history; he tends to universalize and generalize as he suggests that the argument for penal substitutionary atonement rooted in modern western legal theory is actually an intuitively obvious position across time and culture.</p>

<p>But the largest problem with the article comes at the very end. In his concluding paragraph, Galli states:</p>

<blockquote><p>It [penal substitutionary atonement] is the one atonement model more than the others that reminds us of the personal investment of God in each one of us. Where <em>Christus Victor</em>, for example, is a wonderful model to describe cosmic redemption, substitutionary atonement is about my salvation: Christ died for me. It doesn’t get any more personal than that. And evangelical religion is nothing if not personal.</p></blockquote>

<p>To paraphrase: penal substitutionary atonement should be central because this model <em>elevates the individual above all.</em></p>

<p>I want to be clear that I certainly agree that God is a personal God, concerned with us on an individual level, who desires to be in relationship with us.</p>

<p>But when we reduce salvation to the personal we distort the nature of sin.</p>

<p>Sin is significantly bigger than the wrongdoing of any single individual. Sin manifests in broken relationships — between us and God, us and others, us and the natural world. Sin can be personal, as when I angrily snap at a child or harbor envy of a colleague. But sin can also be corporate, as when a church protects abusers at the expense of the abused, or structural, as when societies systematically oppress a group of people.</p>

<p>Sin affects our relationship to the natural world, leading to the exploitations of nature that poison streams and cause animal populations to collapse.</p>

<p>Sin corrupts our relationships with others, prompting colonialism and patriarchy and racism and other problems far larger than any individual.</p>

<p>A focus on personal sin foregrounds individual wrongdoing and pushes the broader scope of redemption into the background. But through Christ, God is redeeming the whole world, making all creation new. Suffering will end, justice will come, and all of the created world (human and inhuman) will be redeemed and renewed. All the broken relationships will be restored.</p>

<p></figure></p>

<p>But in addition to making the scope of salvation smaller, a focus on individual sin allows communities of Christians to ignore other forms of sin. God does redeem our individual sins, but as John Donne noted, no one is an island. Our sins ripple out into our families, our communities, our environment, and God is also redeeming those effects. When churches focus on God&rsquo;s forgiveness for individuals, they often skip the part where communities, not just individuals, need to be made whole.</p>

<p>Racism is one obvious example of the ways in which a focus on individual sin can make the larger effects of sin invisible. If racism is reduced to individual bigotry, the solution is merely individual: all that is necessary is to stop being prejudiced against a certain group of people — and if we trip up, God has already forgiven us. This approach has not worked particularly well in the church, which remains highly segregated.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Only a recognition of sin as broader than any single individual, of sin as manifested in structures of power and privilege, can begin to address the problem of racism.</p>

<p>Another example comes from the #metoo and #churchtoo movements in which women are speaking out about the ways they have been sexually assaulted, harassed and abused. While Hollywood is having a moment of reckoning, churches seem to be much less willing to grapple with the consequences of sexual abuse. Witness the standing ovation when pastor <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/january/andy-savages-standing-ovation-was-heard-round-world-because.html">Andy Savage</a> apologized for assaulting a teenager; witness the <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2018/february/sovereign-grace-rachael-denhollander-sgm-abuse-ct-interview.html?share=">defensive response of Sovereign Grace Ministries</a> to gymnast Rachael Denhollander, who after abuse by Larry Nassar became an advocate for victims of sexual assault in the church.</p>

<p>Viewing sin as purely individual separates sin from the power structures that can enable it, and prevents critical evaluation of those structures. And viewing sin as individual can lead to a greater concern for the sinner than for their victims, as with Andy Savage. Because he apologized, and because of course God forgives him, any lingering pain on the part of the woman he assaulted becomes not a consequence of <em>his</em> sin but a manifestation of <em>her</em> sin, her presumed resentment and lack of forgiveness. This view of sin wants to deny its larger consequences in favor of a simplistic narrative of individual repentance and forgiveness, to the detriment of all of those wounded by the sins of others.</p>

<p>To come back to soteriology: our doctrines of salvation are intimately tied to our ideas about sin. Penal substitutionary atonement certainly emphasizes individual salvation — Jesus took <em>my</em> place, <em>my</em> punishment — and this is true. But Jesus also died for <em>our</em> sins, to reconcile <em>all things</em> to God, and so we must remember that salvation is far bigger than any individual. Making penal substitutionary atonement central reflects the values of our individualistic culture. Any model of salvation will reflect the culture in which it arises; this is not necessarily wrong.</p>

<p>It only becomes wrong when it pushes out understandings of communal salvation and communal sin.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January, John Piper argued that <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/is-there-a-place-for-female-professors-at-seminary">women should not teach in seminaries.</a> While I vehemently disagree with Piper&rsquo;s position, it does flow logically from the complementarian position that does not allow women to have personal, direct authority over men — and especially not authority over men who will become church authorities.</p>

<p>The problem with Piper&rsquo;s argument, though, always comes down to how to draw the boundaries: if women can&rsquo;t pastor, then it follows that they can&rsquo;t teach seminary;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but what about college-level theology to students who don&rsquo;t intend to become pastors? What about Sunday School teachers, or the mothers of sons — at what point do they stop instructing young men? In other words, why do complementarians draw the lines they do?</p>

<p>I had never considered that question until I was in college, taking a required theology class that was taught by a woman. Although I grew up complementarian and was, at the time, opposed to women pastors, I never questioned the ethics of women as theology professors — just as I never questioned the ethics of women teaching any other subject.</p>

<p>However, this particular professor made a comment that stuck with me. I don&rsquo;t remember the context; perhaps we were discussing women in the church, but perhaps not. Regardless, my professor said that if she really believed that Paul forbade women from teaching men in the church in all circumstances, she would have to quit her job teaching theology at a Christian college.</p>

<p>This comment exposed a tension in my thinking that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before: why did I have no problem with a woman teaching theology to not only myself but my fellow male students, while I did have a problem with a woman preaching? Or, to rephrase the question, what exactly did Paul mean by teaching in 1 Timothy 2?</p>

<p>To be clear, many complementarians don&rsquo;t go as far as Piper, or may have reservations about women seminary professors but not women professors of bible and theology at an undergraduate level. After all, they argue, even a Christian college isn&rsquo;t a church; a professor doesn&rsquo;t take the same role as a pastor, or even a preacher.</p>

<p>But as disturbing as I find Piper&rsquo;s comments on women generally, and as encouraging as I&rsquo;ve found the responses (for example, <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/john-piper-needs-help-female-seminary-professors/">here</a> and <a href="http://amyfdavisabdallah.com/two-little-reminders/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/needed-women-seminary-professors-response-john-piper/">here</a>), Piper&rsquo;s position is logically consistent. Teaching Greek may not be the same as teaching homiletics, but I assume that the Greek taught in seminaries is not taught in a contextual void — at the very least, a woman Greek professor is teaching men how to read and handle scripture and she clearly has authority over them in the context of their theological education.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s my point?</p>

<p>Modern-day complementarianism, as propagated through organizations like the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, has an unresolved tension at its core. Most complementarians distance themselves from straight-up patriarchy, arguing that women are equal in value to men, fully created in the image of God. They merely have different <em>roles</em>, which largely means that women are excluded from certain teaching and leadership roles in the church. (I&rsquo;m addressing complementarianism in the church here; complementarianism in marriage has a different set of problems.)</p>

<p>But the problem always is: from what roles are women excluded? Senior pastor? Elder? Adult Sunday school teacher? Reader? Usher? Leadership council? Children&rsquo;s Sunday school teacher? College theology professor? Seminary professor? And embedded in this question is the deeper question of why the lines should be drawn in these ways. Why would a church allow women to serve on the leadership council and to teach adult Sunday school, but not to preach or function as senior pastor? What reasoning lies behind drawing the line at any particular point?</p>

<p>Both patriarchy and egalitarianism offer simplicity: patriarchy sees women as actually inferior to men, less fully created in the image of God, more susceptible to deception and emotionalism. Patriarchy can thus exclude women from any position of leadership, influence or power because it holds that they simply are not capable of the tasks associated with those positions. On the opposite side, egalitarians see women as the equal of men, just as capable and just as likely to be gifted and thus not barred from any role in the church.</p>

<p>Complementarians, however, must wrestle with how to treat women as beings created in God&rsquo;s image while also placing limitations on how they can serve and lead in the church. Some minimize those limitations, while others expand them, but regardless the scriptural basis for those limitations is shaky at best. Holding Paul&rsquo;s statement in 1 Timothy 2 about women not teaching or holding authority over men as universal, not specific to a particular situation in a particular church, leads to significant interpretive gymnastics when women can&rsquo;t lead churches but they can chair committees or lead small groups.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t change my mind about women in the church after my college theology course; that change in my thinking took several more years. But my professor planted a seed that day. I started asking why churches drew the lines they did around the roles of women, and asking on what basis they would draw those particular lines.</p>

<p>Along the way, I discovered that God doesn&rsquo;t fence me in with arbitrary lines, much less view me as a inferior version of men. God desires that I serve in my church and my community using my God-given gifts, whether those lead me to the nursery and kitchen or pulpit and lectern.</p>

<p>Thanks be to God.</p>

<p>As several people have pointed out, part of the debate comes down to the purpose of seminary; Piper assumes that seminaries train pastors, but people without pastoral calls may also attend seminaries. This is an interesting debate, but it still splits hairs by implying that a woman professor teaching the same content is allowable in one set of circumstances (not preparing pastors) and not allowable in another (preparing pastors).<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <title>Women in Christianity: Margery Kempe</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a recurring series on women in Christianity. My goal in this series is not to highlight exceptional women but instead to discuss the many contributions of women that frequently go unremarked or overlooked.

<p>During the season of Advent, I wrote about how the Incarnation is <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">good news for women</a> as it overturns the assumption that the mind (typically figured as masculine) is superior to the body (associated with the feminine). As I considered what woman to choose for a post on women in theology, I wanted to write about someone very aware of her ties to her physical body. While many women theologians could fit this criteria, Margery Kempe immediately sprang to mind.</p>

<p>Margery Kempe lived in England in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. She wrote (or more precisely, she dictated) the first autobiography in English — and one of the first autobiographies in western literature. Margery was a devout Christian, but not from early childhood (as <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-23-2017-catherine-of-siena">Catherine of Siena</a> was). Instead, Margery became devout after what seems like a period of postpartum psychosis after the birth of her first child.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Margery went on to have thirteen more children before convincing her husband to join her in a vow of chastity (understandably enough). But through these childbearing years, Margery engages in multiple forms of devotion from frequent prayers to pilgrimages to wearing a hair shirt (which her husband apparently never notices).</p>

<p>Her devotion is not unique for this period of history; the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Europe saw a flourishing of lay piety — that is, devotion practiced by ordinary people beyond the structures of the priesthood or monasticism. As the middle class grew in the late middle ages and became literate at least in their own vernaculars (even if not literate in Latin), the demand for devotional texts increased and loose communities of the devout formed. These Christians did not want to formally enter the church (as priests, monks or nuns) for a variety of reasons, but they did want to grow spiritually.</p>

<p>The institutional church had an uneasy relationship with these communities. Most people remained orthodox, some like Catherine of Siena affiliating themselves with monastic orders, but groups like the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/review/book-review-wisdom-beguines">Beguines</a> faced accusations of heresy. Most significantly, in Margery Kempe&rsquo;s England a group of people called Lollards had begun following the teachings of John Wycliffe. The Lollards were declared heretical because of their views on the priesthood and the sacraments; they were also persecuted because of their political views.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>While the Lollards are a large and fascinating topic in their own right, most relevant to Margery is the fact that they encouraged itinerant preaching, even by women, to spread their beliefs. So when Margery began traveling and gaining a reputation as a holy women, her status as a middle-class (non-noble) woman outside the church meant that she faced considerable opposition from church authorities.</p>

<p>Margery faced resistance on two main fronts: her weeping and her teaching.</p>

<p>After the birth of her first child, Margery was afflicted or gifted (depending on your point of view) with weeping: when she contemplated the love of Christ and his suffering for her, she was unable to stop crying loudly. For Margery, this weeping was a gift from God, a sign of God&rsquo;s presence in and favor on her life. Weeping was a physical manifestation of her inner experience, and in her autobiography she repeatedly thanks God for allowing her to show her devotion in this physical way.</p>

<p>However, since she was often overcome with weeping in public places and particularly in holy places, church officials frequently chastised her. They believed that she could control her weeping but refused, preferring instead to draw attention to herself. Margery maintained that this was not the case: God caused her to weep, and she had no desire to make herself a public spectacle. Weeping, in all its messy physicality, became a point of tension between Margery and church authority.</p>

<p>But no matter how annoying some found her weeping, it was seldom the main complaint against her. Margery consistently faced opposition, often in the form of imprisonment and examination by church officials, for her teaching. In her account of her examination by the Archbishop of York, Margery carefully positions herself as a messenger of the gospel. She acknowledges that women cannot preach, but asserts that she has occupied no pulpit; she does use &ldquo;communication and good words&rdquo; to proclaim the gospel and argue against corruption in the church, but she claims that Jesus' interactions with women in scripture set a precedent for her to communicate the gospel.</p>

<p>The Archbishop, in Margery&rsquo;s account, can find no fault with this argument — but he still orders Margery to leave his diocese. This incident shows Margery as a participant in communities of lay people who gather to discuss the scripture and spur each other to live holy lives, communities in which women could and often did hold prominent positions as sources of advice and teaching. This incident with the Archbishop also shows the unease in the institutional church over the teachings and practices that may proliferate in such groups. Although Margery is not a Lollard, her willingness to criticize the church and teach her fellow lay Christians overlaps with heretical beliefs — and the existence of these heresies gives the church a reason to detain and question Margery.</p>

<p>But Margery persisted in her travels, her teaching and her weeping; she persisted through finding someone to write down her life;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> she persisted in telling her version of her spiritual life, no matter how unruly that life was in the eyes of the church. And above all, she persisted in asserting that she had received revelations from God.</p>

<p>Even today, it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss Margery Kempe as an attention-seeker, a hysterical woman, even a heretic. But she was also a woman who experienced God tangibly through her tears, an experience that propelled her to a life of devotion amongst a community of others seeking new ways to follow Christ.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always dangerous to diagnose mental illness across cultures and at a distance of 600 years, but Margery&rsquo;s vivid description of her mental breakdown after the birth of her first child seems to show a case of not just postpartum depression but the much rarer postpartum psychosis.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>In short, the Lollards married Wycliffe&rsquo;s view that priests are not necessary intermediaries between the laity and God to the political views that spurred the Peasant Revolts. The Lollards thus challenged the established social order by arguing that neither priests nor kings are so God-ordained as to be above criticism and indeed revolt.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Margery was herself unable to write, although not necessarily unable to read; in the middle ages, reading and writing were distinct skill sets. She thus needed to hire someone to write her narrative. Her first scribe apparently wrote so poorly and in such an idiosyncratic dialect that few could read what he wrote; her second scribe promised to write for her, then backed out because of her tenuous standing with church authorities. This second man, however, referred her to yet a third man, who was able to better understand the first version and, with Margery&rsquo;s help, write the final version of her life.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>January has not been an easy month for me. My depression and anxiety have muted my days and turned my nights sleepless. I am so over the icy chill of midwestern winter mornings, and afternoons, and evenings; I crave the warmth of a muggy piedmont afternoon in North Carolina. I have old friends and new ones, but I miss the friends across the office hall and the students in my old classrooms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of much meaningful to write, or even do, when the weather is grey and the wind bites and the fog of depression and winter descends and blankets everything with a seemingly unending chill.</p>

<p>And so I turn to one of my fail-safe comforts: baking bread. Yesterday, I baked my weekly loaves of sandwich bread, but I also tried my hand at the braided challah bread pictured above. My family crowded into my tiny kitchen to watch and help in the process: my youngest daughter rolled dough with me into strands for the braid. My brother&rsquo;s girlfriend held my laptop at the right angle so I could watch and imitate a YouTube tutorial, while my brother and husband offered moral support as I struggled to master the six-strand braid. My older daughters oohed and aahed over the finished product.</p>

<p>I love the process of making bread. I love the feel of kneaded dough, supple and smooth. I love the magic of yeast, of the bread growing as a living organism. I love the chemistry of heat, transforming the soft pillow of dough into a beautifully browned loaf. I love that I have produced a tangible good in the world, turning flour and water and oil into something nourishing and delicious for my entire family.</p>

<p>Jesus uses <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13:33&amp;version=NIV">yeast worked through dough</a> as a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13:20-21&amp;version=NIV">metaphor for the Kingdom of God.</a> Yeast is such a tiny thing: even when using a starter instead of the modern dry yeast, just a little bit gets mixed with the flour and water and salt and oil. But that little bit transforms the ordinary into something extraordinary, something sacred.</p>

<p>And so I bake bread when I need to remember that the kingdom of heaven is mixed through my life, when I cannot see growth and change. Some breads rise high, escaping their proofing bowls; others puff slowly and almost imperceptibly. But either way, the yeast is working its miracle to change ordinary ingredients into the bread that will sustain others.</p>]]></description>

</figure></p>

<p><em>(Spoilers throughout)</em></p>

<p>I feel a little awkward being in my mid-30s and asking the question of what I want to be when I grow up. After all, I was the college student with a definite plan, and I followed that plan all the way through to the tenure-track academic job. My identity was quite firmly rooted in being a college professor, and now that&rsquo;s not what I am. It&rsquo;s disorienting to deal with that loss while also trying to figure out what I want to be next.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m hooked these days by narratives about people facing identity crises, especially at the point in our mid-30s when we&rsquo;re supposed to be on the path to figuring life out. Enter Amazon&rsquo;s new show, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</em> The show has won well-deserved popular and critical acclaim, winning among other awards Golden Globes for best comedy and best actress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the eight episodes of the show&rsquo;s first season twice now, once while my husband was out of town for a week, and then again with him. I don&rsquo;t watch many shows twice, and almost never twice in the space of two months, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this one as much the second time as the first.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s captured me most about the show is that every major character is struggling with same question I am: what am I going to be when I grow up? Who am I when life takes takes an unexpected turn and yanks away a part of my identity?</p>

<p>The series opens on Midge — the main character, Mrs. Maisel — in the midst of her ideal 1950s New York life: she has fashionable clothes, an account at the local butcher, the rabbi coming for dinner, a huge apartment beneath her parents' apartment, two children (a boy <em>and</em> a girl), and a husband. But over the course of the first episode, this life is shattered: she learns that her husband is having an affair, and he leaves her. It also later comes out that her financial situation is much more precarious than she knew, so she moves back in with her parents.</p>

<p>Midge had gained everything she wanted in life: a college degree, an upwardly mobile husband, a comfortable life, respect in her community. She was blindsided by her husband&rsquo;s betrayal, and the rest of the first season traces her attempts to relocate herself in the midst of so much upheaval. She finds a hidden talent for stand-up comedy, but her path is hardly clear and easy. She finds support and encouragement in the character Susie, who becomes her manager — more on her later — but Midge nevertheless makes multiple missteps and gives horrendous performances as she moves into a new career.</p>

<p>And Midge has to renegotiate more than just her identity: she must navigate a new relationship with her parents, as an adult child once again living at home. She has to renegotiate her place in her community as her marriage dissolves. She has to navigate employment and babysitters and the court system on her own, and while the show is a comedy the difficulty of Midge&rsquo;s position is clear.</p>

<p>Losing her identity as &ldquo;wife&rdquo; throws Midge into chaos. But the show is ultimately hopeful: losing this one part of her identity hurts, but it also creates space for other parts of her identity to emerge and flourish.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just Midge reevaluating her identity. Her husband, Joel, leaves in part because he feels stifled by the perfect 1950s life — but as Midge brutally observes, he has left her to live the Methodist version of his old life, not to live a new type of life. Joel then goes on to reevaluate his actions, confronting the fact that he threw away a good life in favor of a pale imitation because his discontent went far deeper than the externals of beautiful wife, two children, and luxurious uptown apartment.</p>

<p>Likewise, Susie — who works at the club where Midge first tries stand-up — sees Midge as her golden opportunity to not just watch performers but to shape one by becoming Midge&rsquo;s manager. Susie is grasping after a golden opportunity, and one that she has thought about before, so her identity crisis is much less acute than Midge&rsquo;s. But the two women must both work through what their new positions and relationship mean, and like Midge, Susie doesn&rsquo;t transition smoothly.</p>

<p>Even Midge&rsquo;s parents must grapple with change: while her father is offered his dream job at Bell Labs, Midge&rsquo;s mother has difficulty coping with the fact that her daughter may not have the life that both women envisioned. She cannot accept that Joel and Midge&rsquo;s separation may be permanent because a divorced daughter does not fit into the life she has always assumed she would have. (Midge&rsquo;s parents don&rsquo;t yet know of her ventures into the world of comedy; I imagine this will be a major plot point of the next season.)</p>

<p><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> is about how the disintegration of Midge&rsquo;s marriage spirals out around her, forcing her to reevaluate her life and her identity but also bringing change into many other lives. Midge displays resilience and determination, but she and those around her experience grief and bewilderment and frustration through this process.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this show reflects the unexpected turns that life can take, and the pain that ensues when a cherished part of our identities collapses. It also normalizes this process: Midge has a crisis, but she will survive. And if a 1950s housewife can reshape herself as a stand-up comic, perhaps we too can survive our own crises of identity.</p>]]></description>

<p>If progressive Christians have a favorite bible verse, it is most likely <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6:8&amp;version=NIV">Micah 6:8</a>: &ldquo;He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo; But what does it mean to act justly and also love mercy?</p>

<p>Justice and mercy are often seen as opposites, not companions. Yet repeatedly in scripture we see them coming together, as in one of my favorite images of justice and mercy. This one is found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+85&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 85:10</a> (or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+84:11&amp;version=DRA">84:11</a> in the Vulgate, from which I&rsquo;m quoting): &ldquo;Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle ages, these four virtues were personified as the daughters of God, and the meeting and reconciliation between Mercy and Justice was often dramatized as a prelude to the Incarnation. (The image above, from the early fifteenth century, depicts the conflict between Mercy and Truth before the throne of God.)</p>

<p>While the details vary, the main point of contention between Mercy and Truth is whether humanity can be redeemed from their sins (mercy) or must suffer the penalty for their sins (truth). The two are reconciled in Christ, whose death satisfies justice while also providing mercy. Thus mercy and justice, peace and truth, meet through the person of Christ — and without him, they would remain at odds.</p>

<p>This medieval image of the daughters of God was meant to explain salvation through allegory. But it&rsquo;s also instructive as we think about acting justly and loving mercy ourselves: we almost inevitably value one above the other, and bringing them together often seems beyond our human capability.</p>

<hr />

<p>To show how difficult acting justly and mercifully can be, two brief case studies:</p>

<p>First, I came across a story in December about a 19-year-old undocumented immigrant, who while working as a housekeeper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/12/15/a-maid-stole-some-rings-then-returned-them-a-jury-convicted-her-then-paid-her-fine-was-that-right/?utm_term=.03e1d15d1f0a">stole three rings</a> from a home she was cleaning. Although she didn&rsquo;t confess at first, she later did admit to the theft and return the rings. However, under Virginia law, she was still tried and convicted of felony theft. The jury imposed a fine of only $60 — the equivalent of a day&rsquo;s wages for this young woman — and then took up a collection to pay the fine for her.</p>

<p>The woman whose rings were stolen was aghast at the mercy shown to this young woman, arguing that justice was hardly served. The members of the jury felt that the felony conviction was more than enough justice; they wanted to show mercy in determining a low fine, and then paying it themselves.</p>

<p>Was justice served, if the housekeeper faced few consequences for her crime? Was mercy served, if the housekeeper now has a felony on her record because of a youthful mistake?</p>

<p>Case study #2: Andy Savage, megachurch pastor, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/us/tennessee-pastor-sexual-incident-teen-apology-applause/index.html">sexually assaulted a teenage girl</a> twenty years ago when he was leading a youth ministry (he has referred to this as a &ldquo;sexual incident&rdquo;). The woman, Jules Woodson, publicly <a href="http://watchkeep.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/silent-no-more-survivor-of-sexual.html">recounted her story</a> as part of the broader #MeToo movement after privately confronting Savage without receiving a response.</p>

<p>On January 7, during the Sunday morning service at his church, Savage confessed to the &ldquo;incident,&rdquo; claiming to be truly sorry and to be committed to working towards healing. The congregation responded with a standing ovation. (For a thoughtful analysis of this applause and why it is problematic, read <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/january/andy-savages-standing-ovation-was-heard-round-world-because.html">Ed Stetzer&rsquo;s <em>Christianity Today</em> article.</a>)</p>

<p>Savage is facing some consequences, despite his congregation&rsquo;s support; he is taking a leave of absence while Woodson&rsquo;s allegations are independently investigated, and Bethany House has cancelled publication of his book on marriage.</p>

<p>Is justice served by an investigation? Is mercy served by a standing ovation?</p>

<hr />

<p>In Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Portia argues eloquently for mercy for her friend Antonio in the famous speech beginning, &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained; / It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath.&rdquo; Yet only minutes after this passionate plea for mercy, Portia relentlessly tears down the entirety of Shylock&rsquo;s life, from his riches to his religion, reducing him to begging for his life. She has no mercy for the Jewish moneylender.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knows, as he so often does, that we like mercy when it applies to us and ours — but not so much when those unlike us (culturally, socio-economically, religiously) ask for it. Justice is much more appealing in those circumstances.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the sort of post with a neat answer. We can see that mercy and justice meet in the person of Christ, and we can agree that as we become more Christ-like we should seek to both do justice and love mercy. But that is far harder than simply quoting Micah, and in fact it may be impossible for our still-fallen human nature.</p>

<p>We can start by checking our own impulses: to whom do we want to show mercy, and who do we think deserves justice? And what do justice and mercy look like in particular situations? If we are committed to these two often competing virtues, we must be committed to the difficult, complicated, messy work that they entail.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Failure and Perfection</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>Last weekend, we went ice skating as a family for the first time. My daughters and husband had a great time, while I literally fell flat on my face. And my derriere. I made my way slowly and painfully around the rink only one time before throwing in the towel. It was, to say the least, embarrassing.</p>

<p>That was not how I envisioned the morning. I imagined us skating as a family, laughing as we glided around the ice together. I imagined helping my daughters up from falls and encouraging them to try again. Instead, they were the ones offering help and encouraging me: &ldquo;You can do it, mom! Good job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m prone to idealistic thinking, and it&rsquo;s good to imagine how things can be at their very best. When I was teaching, I constantly reworked my syllabi to better achieve my goals — I even worked on redesigning an entire major. I&rsquo;ve grown to love the process of revising my writing, reworking sentences to be tighter, clearer, more forceful or graceful. I tweak recipes that I make frequently, adjusting proportions until the end result matches my aspirations.</p>

<p>My desire to get things right has made me a good teacher and researcher. It keeps my desk clear and my meals planned, my deadlines met and my children delivered to school on time.</p>

<p>But this idealism has another name: perfectionism.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the darker side of my idealism. Perfectionism means that the ideal — the often impossible ideal — is my goal. Perfect doesn&rsquo;t mean that my kids eat reasonably healthy meals most days; it means that I cheerfully cook balanced dinners every night and never serve mac and cheese from a box or order a pizza.</p>

<p>Perfect doesn&rsquo;t leave room for failures, and in my perfectionism any deviation from the ideal is a failure.</p>

<p>I know, of course, that living with this perfectionism is unsustainable. But as my fellow perfectionists understand, it can be hard to reconcile that knowledge with the strong feeling that if we just try hard enough we can, indeed, attain the ideal. After all, doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1:13-16&amp;version=NIV">the bible tell us</a> to be holy as God is holy? And if we should aim for this high ideal, why not all the high ideals?</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m learning, slowly, sometimes painfully, always imperfectly, how to live in the tension between the ideal good and the imperfect real. I can&rsquo;t abandon my ideals; hope, after all, depends on believing that things can be better, believing I can be better. But I also have to accept that I can&rsquo;t be perfect. I can&rsquo;t be as holy as God, even if I am supposed to aim for that goal. I can&rsquo;t live a life without failure. I can&rsquo;t even excel at everything: I have to balance my sanity against a vision of my children happily eating vegetables every night.</p>

<p>So last weekend, I had to accept that my ideal vision of joyful family skating simply didn&rsquo;t match reality. And you know what? It was okay. I applauded my daughters as they went around the rink, gaining confidence in a new activity even as they fell. I even applauded myself for making it once around rink and not quitting after the first fall. And I want to try again, with a better pair of skates but also with the expectation that we will have fun in the midst of falls and failures.</p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the ideal after all.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Racism and the Church</title>

<p>Had Martin Luther King Jr. not been assassinated in 1968, he would have been 88 years old today.</p>

<p>That fact catches me by surprise; he was younger, by a few years, than my grandparents. Growing up white in vast-majority-white small towns in the west and midwest, my knowledge of the civil rights era came from a few pages in my history textbook. Racism was an individual problem, but certainly not one we had. We didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see race.&rdquo; We also didn&rsquo;t happen to interact with many non-white people, and I didn&rsquo;t have friends from other races as a child. The Civil Rights movement seemed to be a historical relic of a less-enlightened time.</p>

<p>I was in college before I began to have an inkling that the Civil Rights movement, despite making some progress, hardly erased the effects of centuries of slavery and decades of legally-enshrined unequal treatment of people of color. And it took even longer to understand racism as not just an individual issue but a systemic one, and to further understand that racism often emerges in more subtle ways than wearing white hoods and burning crosses.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write much about racism because I feel ill-equipped to say anything useful. I&rsquo;m a white middle-class woman who grew up in small western and midwestern towns with little racial diversity and who entered a profession — academia — that for all its progressive stances is not particularly good at welcoming and supporting scholars of color.</p>

<p>And so I stay mostly silent on racism. I don&rsquo;t want to come across as ignorant; as an academic in a humanities field I&rsquo;m painfully aware that I don&rsquo;t have a solid grounding in critical race theory. I also don&rsquo;t want to come across as a white savior; without the lived experience of a person of color, I don&rsquo;t have any authority on the best solutions to the variety of challenges they face.</p>

<p>But I also don&rsquo;t want my silence to come across as cowardice or complicity in racist structures and attitudes.</p>

<p>The Trump presidency has made it painfully clear that many people in America are deeply racist, and willing to be open about their racism. And even more Americans, including over 80% of evangelical Christians, either supported or were willing to overlook Trump&rsquo;s blatant racism and vote for him to lead our nation.</p>

<p>I want to stand against this racism, teach my children that as Christians we must honor other human beings and, as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:1-5&amp;version=NIV">Paul encouraged the Corinthians</a>, value others above ourselves.</p>

<p>I also want to work to make the church a better reflection of the coming kingdom, in which every people group will join together to worship God. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q881g1L_d8">In 1960</a>, Martin Luther King Jr. called Sunday morning &ldquo;the most segregated hour in America.&rdquo; 58 years later, numbers have improved slightly, but according to LifeWay research <a href="http://lifewayresearch.com/2015/01/15/sunday-morning-in-america-still-segregated-and-thats-ok-with-worshipers/">well over 80% of congregations</a> are still made up of primarily one race. The <a href="http://www.thearda.com/ConQS/qs_298.asp">2012 National Congregations Study</a> found that in more than 70% of white evangelical, conservative or fundamentalist churches, African-Americans make up less than 5% of the congregation.</p>

<p>Racism, even racism specifically in the church, is a large problem, and one that will take the concerted efforts of many people to address. So this year, as I work through my non-fiction reading list, I&rsquo;m educating myself about racism and the lived experiences of people of color. I&rsquo;m listening to their narratives, their analysis, their lived experience so that I can remember that my experience is not normative.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading <em>The History of White People</em> by Nell Irvin Painter, and I&rsquo;m moving Christena Cleveland&rsquo;s <em>Disunity in Christ</em> and Drew G. I. Hart&rsquo;s <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen: Changing the Way the Church Views Racism</em> to the top of my to-be-read pile. I read essays by Ta-Nehesi Coates and Roxane Gay (and Marvel&rsquo;s <em>Black Panther</em> comics, with issues written by both).</p>

<p>When I have time, I listen to podcasts: NPR&rsquo;s <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch">podcast</a> is an excellent starting point for understanding issues of race in America (as is the <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/">blog</a>). I&rsquo;ve also started listening to <a href="http://www.podasterystudios.com/truths-table/"><em>Truth&rsquo;s Table</em></a>, hosted by three black women who discuss race and faith in ways that are incredibly enlightening and challenging.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to follow more people of color on Twitter, and as a starting point I recommend Gene Demby (@GeeDee215), one of the hosts of the <em>Code Switch</em>. Christena Cleveland (@CSCleve) and Austin Channing Brown (@austinchanning) are also great resources.</p>

<p>Listening to voices outside of my own experience and tradition as a white person won&rsquo;t solve all social ills, but it is a necessary step. In 2018, will you join with me in working to combat racism and build a church that honors the <em>imago dei</em> in all people? We are all starting from different points, but we must have this (often painful and uncomfortable) discussion in the church if we are to reflect the peace and unity of our resurrection life.</p>

            <title>The White Witch and Oliver Cromwell</title>

<p>So, I have this theory about the White Witch in C.S. Lewis' <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.</em></p>

<p>She&rsquo;s inspired by Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>I can hear your shocked gasps over the internet. Oliver Cromwell? The seventeenth-century English general who led the Parliamentary forces that defeated the royal army? The Oliver Cromwell who was one of the signers of Charles I&rsquo;s death warrant? The Oliver Cromwell who ruled England as Lord Protector (more or less a military dictator) from 1653-58? The Oliver Cromwell who played a major role in one of the most audacious political experiments in Europe?</p>

<p>Yep, that Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p><figure class="float-left">

<p>Hear me out. What&rsquo;s the White Witch known for? Ruling Narnia with an icy fist, locking the country in a 100-year winter and never allowing Father Christmas to enter. Always winter and never Christmas, which is about the bleakest existence I can imagine (and imagine it I do, every February when Christmas is a distant memory and spring a distant dream).</p>

<p>(If I may be permitted a digression: I never once though of this until I started writing this blog post, but how in the world is anyone still alive in Narnia after 100 years of winter? How is anyone finding food to eat? The plants must all be dead, and I can&rsquo;t imagine the animals survived for more than a year or two without food.</p>

<p>Some dwarves are on the White Witch&rsquo;s side, and although Lewis never explains Narnia&rsquo;s economics, it&rsquo;s reasonable to suppose that they have an arrangement in which the Witch and the dwarves can profit from whatever they export from their mines. Thus the dwarves and White Witch may have money to  import food, and the Witch can feed her police and her informants, but pretty soon there wouldn&rsquo;t be anyone left to police or inform upon.</p>

<p>Plus which, if I were a Narnian, I think after about two years of dictatorship, never-ending winter, scurvy, and no Christmas, I&rsquo;d be like: screw this, we&rsquo;re moving to Calormen.</p>

<p>Of course, 100 years could be enough time for some evolutionary adaptation, so maybe just enough grows to sustain a tiny population — like the Beavers, and the fish Mr. Beaver catches for the young human children.</p>

<p>Am I overthinking this? Yes, yes I am. But now you can overthink it, too!)</p>

<p>Anyway. Back to my theory: the White Witch as Oliver Cromwell. Despite the recent decision to re-order new editions of the series, <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> was the first Narnia book written, and all we know about the White Witch in that book beyond her sorcerous powers is that she deposed the true monarch of Narnia, took power herself, locked Narnia in endless winter, and prevented the celebration of Christmas.</p>

<p>Now, the historical Cromwell was certainly not a sorcerer, and he did not change the English weather patterns. But he was one of the key players in the political upheaval that led to the trial and execution of the English king (Charles I) and the establishment of a Republic. This political experiment was short-lived; after four years of struggle by Parliament to establish a coherent government, Cromwell himself took power and ruled England as Lord Protector, and at his death was succeeded by his son.</p>

<p>The shocking and revolutionary political experiment then collapsed, and the English monarchy was restored in 1660 when Parliament invited Charles II, the son of the executed Charles I, to return to England as king.</p>

<p>History has, as one might imagine, viewed Cromwell in a variety of ways; for me today, at a distance of 350 years and living in a democratic republic, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to sympathize with Cromwell and the other English republicans who had grown distrustful of monarchy as a system of government.</p>

<p>But for a royalist, Cromwell is nothing short of a traitor, willing to kill a king anointed by God in order to seize power himself. Lewis seems to fall into this category: his White Witch, or King Miraz in <em>Prince Caspian,</em> show the dangers of monarchial power — yet the remedy is not a different form of government, but the restoration of the <em>true</em> monarch.</p>

<p>So far, so good: the White Witch and Cromwell both depose rightful monarchs, bringing chaos into their realms; Lewis has reason to pattern his king-killing despot after a figure in his own cultural history. But of course, Cromwell is far from the only person to ever depose a ruler, so this is not conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>What seals the comparison? Forbidding Christmas.</p>

<p>Now, Narnia is magical; there, Father Christmas is real, although prevented from entering by the White Witch&rsquo;s magic. Cromwell had no magic, and no real Father Christmas to keep out of England. But he, along with many other Puritan leaders, were appalled at the feasting, games and high spirits of the season; additionally, the Puritans were deeply of suspicious of holidays they viewed as &ldquo;popish,&rdquo; or originating in Catholicism rather than scripture.</p>

<p>So in 1645, Parliament banned the celebration of Christmas: there were to be no carols, no plays (like Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Twelfth Night,</em> meant to cap the twelve days of revelry from December 25 to January 6), no decorations, no time off for members of Parliament. According to the Puritans, Christmas celebrations were neither moral nor religiously significant, and thus the laws prohibited the citizens of England from observing Christmas either socially or spiritually.</p>

<p>(For more on this ban on Christmas, including the Christmas riots of 1647, I recommend <a href="http://www.historyextra.com/feature/no-christmas-under-cromwell-puritan-assault-christmas-during-1640s-and-1650s">this short article</a>.)</p>

<p>To be fair to Cromwell, he did not personally order the ban on Christmas. But it&rsquo;s also quite clear that he supported and encouraged the ban; during his years as Lord Protector, he continued to enforce the prohibitions against celebrating Christmas. Only when Charles II was restored to the throne could English citizens once again legally celebrate Christmas.</p>

<p>So to recap, Oliver Cromwell deposed a rightful monarch, took power himself, and forbade the celebration of Christmas. And order was only restored to England when the rightful monarch returned to the throne. It&rsquo;s not much of a stretch to see Cromwell as an inspiration for the White Witch.</p>

<p>Now, I freely admit that my theory doesn&rsquo;t change how I read and enjoy <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.</em> But every time I see something about the so-called &ldquo;war on Christmas,&rdquo; I think about Cromwell and the White Witch. Christmas can be a point of contention, a flashpoint for questions about morality and religion — even if today we question the morality of consumerism and the place of Christmas in a pluralistic society.</p>

<p>Let us not be Cromwells or Jadises, squelching the joy of the holiday for others. Let us instead be Father Christmases, celebrating with ringing sleigh bells and generous gifts and feasting and hope as we point to the one who makes Christmas possible.</p>]]></description>

<p>I hate New Years resolutions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perfectionist by nature, so when I fail to keep a resolution — as I inevitably do — I feel like a failure and then I toss the resolution and then fail like a failure for tossing the resolution. It&rsquo;s not a particularly healthy cycle, so I&rsquo;ve given myself a pass on the resolutions for the last several years. Besides which, on the academic schedule I&rsquo;ve followed for my entire adult life, August always feels more like the start of a new year. August resolutions aren&rsquo;t really a thing, so I can&rsquo;t fail at those.</p>

<p>But this year, for the first time, my kids are going back to school and I&rsquo;m not. 2017 was a rough year, and I feel the need to regroup and think about what I want to accomplish as I move forward. I&rsquo;m not making resolutions. But I am making goals and giving myself a word for 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop picking up my phone when I wake up. I always intend to just check the weather, but then I check my calendar, and my to-do list, and my email, and once I&rsquo;ve done that I might as well check Facebook, and then Twitter … and then the lunches need to packed and the kids need breakfast and I&rsquo;m still in my pajamas and annoyed about whatever I&rsquo;ve seen on social media. Breakfast of champions, digital edition. I&rsquo;m not sure if I can stay off social media until noon, but I can at least wait until the kids are out the door.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more non-fiction. My non-fiction to-be-read pile is embarrassingly large (my fiction pile is also embarrassingly large, but at least it rotates), and given a choice I almost always pick up the fiction to read. My awesome theology book club is a help here, but in 2018 I want to put a dent in my pile of non-fiction books.</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing my book. I&rsquo;m still processing my life post-academia, but I want to start moving forward. And even though I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what that looks like, with the blog launched I&rsquo;m ready to start working on something bigger.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>My Word:</strong></p>

<p>Three goals, one word for the new year, and that word is SPACE.</p>

<p>A lot happened to me in 2017, and I&rsquo;m still processing much of it. I like results; I like decisions; I don&rsquo;t like uncertainty and waiting. But in 2018, I want to give myself space.</p>

<p>Space to grieve and to heal. Space to try new things, and to fail, and to try again. Space to breathe on bad days, space to be spontaneous and happy on good ones.</p>

<p>Space to fail at my goals, and start again.</p>

<p>Space for old friendships to move into new patterns and space for new friendships to grow.</p>

<p>Space for the Holy Spirit in my life, to listen and learn and grow in my faith.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be seduced by the expectation that a new year will be a better year and by the hope that I will end 2018 as the impossibly perfect version of myself. So I also want to give 2018 space to be hard and unpleasant and full of anger and sadness and failures. But I hope, through all that the year may hold, that I will grow and work and learn and love and hope.</p>

<p>And I pray the same for all of you.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! I&rsquo;m taking a bit of a break for the holidays and spending time comforting my poor southern daughters, who are struggling with the sub-zero temperatures of the current cold snap. Much snuggling under warm blankets has been necessary (ah, the burdens of parenthood … ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to posting on a regular schedule next Monday, and coming up this month I&rsquo;ll be discussing Oliver Cromwell, the White Witch, Margery Kempe, and my hopes for 2018.</p>

<p>I also have a guest post today on the Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE International) blog, in which I address the argument that husbands are responsible for their wives' sanctification (spoiler: they aren&rsquo;t). Read that piece <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-husbands-cant-get-her-ready-jesus?platform=hootsuite">here</a>, and while you&rsquo;re there check out the other fantastic resources on CBE&rsquo;s website.</p>]]></description>

<p>I meant to put this up yesterday, but I was distracted by Santa&rsquo;s generosity with Dove chocolates, a Christmas nap with a snuggling child, and a family viewing of that holiday classic, <em>The Lego Batman Movie.</em></p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still Christmas — if the second day, not the first. Instead of two calling birds, I give you a poem by the nineteenth-century British poet Christina Rossetti. Her poetry often reflects on the experience of being a woman, and this poem is no exception: she places Mary&rsquo;s simply, physical breastmilk and kiss on the same level as the worship of heavenly beings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bleak Midwinter,&rdquo; Christina Rossetti (via <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53216/in-the-bleak-midwinter">Poetry Foundation</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,</p>

<p>Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;</p>

<p>Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>

<p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;</p>

<p>Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed</p>

<p>The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,</p>

<p>Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,</p>

<p>The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p>

<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,</p>

<p>Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;</p>

<p>But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,</p>

<p>Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.</p>

<p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?</p>

<p>If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;</p>

<p>If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;</p>

<p>Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>May you have a joyous Christmas season, in the promise and hope of Advent and Incarnation.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>The 6th and final part of an Advent series on incarnation. Read the whole series: <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>, and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-18-2017-advent-incarnation-V">part 5</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I write this, I can feel the tickle in the back of my throat that tells me I&rsquo;m about to get an early gift from my four-year-old: her cold. On a larger scale, I am still both physically and emotionally exhausted from ending a career this year that I had though I&rsquo;d be in for the rest of my life and then moving cross-country. I started medication for anxiety a month ago, and I can finally feel the tension beginning to ease out of my shoulders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about how the Incarnation, the first coming of Christ two millennia ago in Bethlehem, teaches us to value physical bodies. After all, if the creator of the universe chose to become a human being and live among human beings, how can we live as though our bodies don&rsquo;t matter, or are hindrances to be overcome?</p>

<p>And yet, having a body sucks.</p>

<p>Our bodies get sick, with colds and cancers and chronic illness. Our bodies get tired and injured. Our bodies age. Our bodies experience the effects of mental illness, of stress, of late nights and early mornings, of difficult relationships and circumstances. Our bodies die.</p>

<p>During Advent, we remember that Christ came as a helpless infant, taking on human flesh and dwelling among us. But we also hope for his return, when we too will be recreated in new bodies free from the effects of sin. For Advent brings with it the promise not just of the coming king but of resurrection, of new birth, of new creation.</p>

<p>Advent is, in part, a time of joy, hope and anticipation — and the ubiquity of Christmas in American culture can often make us feel as though we are somehow deficient if we can&rsquo;t get into the Christmas spirit. No one wants to be an Ebenezer Scrooge at the holidays. But often, the problem is not that our hearts are two sizes too small; the problem is that our hearts are broken and our bodies are weary.</p>

<p>The good news is that Advent, the Incarnation, isn&rsquo;t about Christmas cheer. Oh, celebration is good: Advent is about the joy of God&rsquo;s presence among us. But Advent is also about the longing of God&rsquo;s people for their savior. We long for what we don&rsquo;t yet have, we mourn for the brokenness in the world, we suffer from sin and death and decay.</p>

<p>Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to just be happy. Advent acknowledges our pain and loss and sadness, and says: look, here is hope: hope in the willingness of a teenage girl to become the mother of God, hope in her husband who accepted her despite her pregnancy, hope in the shepherds and wise men who came to bow before the ruler of the universe in the form of a child. Hope that God&rsquo;s kingdom is coming, has come, will one day fully arrive.</p>

<p>But hope only works when life is not as it should be, just as light only makes sense in the darkness. For my readers in the northern hemisphere, today is the shortest day of the year, and Advent is framed by these dark winter weeks. The world is cold and dead, and we remember that we still suffer in sin and darkness; our physical bodies bear the marks of sin and death. But on this, the shortest day of the year, we remember that spring will return. Winter may stay for months, but we know that spring is coming. Life is coming.</p>

<p>Unlike spring, which always arrives, some of us may never experience healing in our bodies in this life. The waiting is much more difficult when we can&rsquo;t count down the days until warmth and life returns. But Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to deny the painful realities of our present lives.</p>

<p>Advent simply asks us to remember that there is hope. Hope in a manger in Bethlehem, hope that Christ will come again, hope in God&rsquo;s ultimate victory over sin and death.</p>

<p>The Incarnation, all those years ago in the body of a teenage girl, tells us that God created us good, values our bodies, mourns with us over the pain these bodies bring. It is also a promise that one day, all will be made whole again, and the effects of sin and evil and death will be removed from our recreated bodies.</p>

<p>In the words of Julian of Norwich, Advent asks us to hope that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.</p>

<p>(For anyone struggling to feel the holiday spirit in 2017, I highly recommend Rachel Held Evans' article <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/unsentimental-advent">&ldquo;Mary, the Magnificat, and an Unsentimental Advent&rdquo;</a>.)</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 5 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, or <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>.</em></p>

<p>How do you feel about God today?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awkward question for me to write. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to <em>know</em> about God, not <em>feel</em> about him? Doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9">Jeremiah tell us</a> that the heart is deceitful above all things?</p>

<p>But living in a body means having emotions. Even if we try to deny, suppress or muscle through those emotions, they still exist, often manifesting in physical ways: hunched shoulders, clenched fists, butterflies, tears, laughter, relaxation. If we elevate mind over body, we also elevate mind over emotions — an elevation further exacerbated by the association of emotions with femininity and weakness.</p>

<p>But once again, the Incarnation forces us to think about the whole experience of having bodies: experience which includes emotions. The body incorporates both mind and emotion, and attempts to deny or diminish this ignore the created reality of our physical existence and experience.</p>

<p>Every person, of course, experiences emotions differently (and different cultures understand emotions <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">in different ways</a>). But emotions are a sign of being human, of having the capacity to respond to our world with more than just logic; emotions are a part of the divine image within humanity. Additionally, emotions are not somehow feminine; despite the way modern American culture suppresses men&rsquo;s emotions, men are not less emotional beings that women (and emotion is not feminine weakness).</p>

<p>We see Jesus experience and express emotions during his time on earth: his grief over the death of Lazarus, his weary need to withdraw from the crowds, his anger at the merchants and money-changers in the temple, his gentle exasperation with his disciples for misunderstanding his teachings. And more, we see Jesus experience and address his emotions. He weeps when he grieves and he goes to pray alone when he needs to rest from the demands of the crowd, rather than ignore or suppress his feelings.</p>

<p>I confess that emotions can be difficult for me. I tend to be controlled and reserved; I don&rsquo;t like feeling out of control emotionally, and it often seems safer to tuck emotions away rather than actually acknowledge and deal with them. And more, emotions aren&rsquo;t always a suitable guide for our actions or even a proportionate response to whatever evoked them. In short, emotions are messy, unpredictable, and often illogical.</p>

<p>But emotions can be good, as well. The joy of a child watching the first snow of winter. The upwelling of gratitude for the kindness of a friend. The flutters of love for a significant other. The peace of an ocean sunrise. Even our anger and grief can connect us to others and spur us to action.</p>

<p>The heart may be deceitful; we&rsquo;ve all experienced misleading emotional reactions. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that the heart is somehow more deceitful than the mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18-31">Paul reminds us</a> that the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of the world; human reason alone cannot get us all the way to God any more than human emotion can.</p>

<p>God gives us both reason and emotion, and both have their place. In fallen, sinful human bodies, neither can be wholly trusted — but neither can be wholly dismissed. Emotion can temper our reason, reminding us that real people are affected by the rational arguments that we make on any number of topics. And reason can temper emotion, helping to move us beyond our initial reactions.</p>

<p>When we insist on logic and dismiss emotions as deceptive, we buy into a valuation of body and emotion rooted in Greek philosophy, not God&rsquo;s created reality. This denigration of our emotional selves emerges especially from strains of theology that emphasize orthodoxy (that <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">right mental furniture</a>) over orthopraxy, and from theologies that prize authority over experience. Both tell us to suppress emotions in favor of reason, whether our own or that of an authority figure (or a combination of both). I should note that this is my own tradition; the holiness tradition often goes in the opposite direction, valuing emotion above reason, and both imbalances can be dangerous.</p>

<p>You may also notice, reading this post, that I&rsquo;m trying to use rational argument to show that we should value emotion. Most people, it seems, gravitate to one over the other; I gravitate towards reason (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re shocked to learn). But despite our own tendencies, we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss our emotional selves.</p>

<p>To do so denies our created reality and thus denies the reality of the Incarnation, which placed immeasurable value on our created bodies.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 4 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a> and <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3 here</a></em></p>

<p>Over the last three posts, I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the ramification of the Incarnation — for bodies, for systems of belief, for women. But Advent is about both the already and the not yet: the world in which we live and believe and work and grieve and laugh, and the fully redeemed world for which we hope. Advent asks us to remember that Christ came, as a baby in a stable, and that he will one day come again.</p>

<p>Advent asks us to hold together the past and future, to step for a moment out of the linear time of alarm clocks and shopping days that rules our daily lives. Advent reminds that we are waiting for the coming savior, like Anna and Simeon at the temple, like Elizabeth and Zechariah, like the prophets of old.</p>

<p>And Advent should remind us that when the savior comes, it may not look like we expect.</p>

<p>The Christmas story is so familiar to most of us as to be almost banal. The manger, the shepherds, the wise men — we know the drill. Plus, we&rsquo;re used to the sanitized version, the adorable kids in lamb costumes, the nativities carefully unwrapped from tissue paper. Even if we understand how radical it was for Christ, the creator of the universe, to be born to a humble family in the humblest of circumstances, it can be hard to fully grasp how different this was from how most first-century Jews would have imagined the birth of their savior.</p>

<p>But we should be humbled by this reminder: how might Christ&rsquo;s second coming look different from what we imagine? And I don&rsquo;t just mean different from the predictions of a Harold Camping or Hal Lindsey (or, dare I say, a Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins). If God first came in the humblest possible manner, and proceeded to live a life amongst the poor and oppressed and sinful people of a conquered territory, what does this suggest about his second coming?</p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed, we affirm that Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead — and if we&rsquo;re honest, we either ignore that part (judgment is often unpleasant) or assume that it will apply to others: Christ will judge people who actually deserve it, a group that surely does not include us. I think it&rsquo;s plain old human nature to assume that Jesus will affirm our rightness, or at least extend us grace, while hoping (secretly or not) for him to condemn others.</p>

<p>But the New Testament is full of warnings about judgment: I mentioned the passage in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46">Matthew</a> last week, where Jesus sends away those who did not feed the hungry or clothe the naked because what they did not do &ldquo;to the least of these&rdquo; they did not do to Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7:21-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a> even more clearly states that not everyone who says &ldquo;lord, lord&rdquo; to Jesus will be saved. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+3&amp;version=NIV">1 John 3</a>, the apostle John warns us that if we do not love we are murderers — and that we must love with actions, not just words.</p>

<p>These are uncomfortable passages, especially for us <em>sola fide</em> protestants; they carry the impression that our actions, and not just our mental faith furniture, matter for our salvation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tear down one of the pillars of the Reformation, although I will note that orthodox Christianity in all its forms affirms both truths that only God can save and that our actions here on earth matter. So when we think of Christ returning in glory and judgment, we have to consider our own actions and how they align with the kingdom that Jesus inaugurated with his first coming.</p>

<p>And what does that kingdom look like? What sort of world do we see Jesus pointing towards in his time on earth?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a kingdom of healing, both physical and spiritual. It&rsquo;s a kingdom of grace for sinners. It&rsquo;s a kingdom that has no place for the rich and prideful, for those who jockey for positions of power and authority, for those who place heavy religious burdens on the backs of others. It&rsquo;s a kingdom inherited by the meek, built by the peacemakers, inhabited by the poor in spirit. It&rsquo;s a kingdom where a worker can get a full day&rsquo;s wage for just a few hours of work, where a heartbreaking disappointment of a son is welcomed home with open arms, where each individual matters regardless of their station in life.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the kingdom that Christ inaugurated with his incarnation, death and resurrection, his return will likely also disrupt and upend the systems that seem so natural and right to us today. And so even as we hope and long for Christ&rsquo;s return, we must do so with humility and the sober awareness that we might just be the Romans and the Pharisees rather than the least of these.</p>

<p>This is a challenge for me, to be sure. Tidy categories of right and wrong make judgment much easier to contemplate. And believing the right thing is simpler than doing the right thing. I do believe that sin exists and that beliefs matter. But as I&rsquo;ve discussed in the last several posts, the Incarnation means that we cannot stop at belief; what we do with our bodies in the physical world also matters. As members of the already-and-not-yet kingdom, we will inevitably fail to fully live into the tangible peace and justice and love of that kingdom — but we are to try anyway.</p>

<p>So this Advent season, may we remember Jesus' first coming and look forward to his second. And may we remember that his first coming upended any conventional idea about what it would mean for God to dwell among us, as one of us. Let us not become complacent that our right beliefs will insulate us from judgment, and let us not grow weary in doing good.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 3 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a></em></p>

<p>The season of Advent reminds us that God took on human flesh; it also reminds us that this process requires women willing to allow God to work through their bodies. Women play vital roles in the Christmas story: Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; Anna, awaiting the Messiah in the temple; the Old Testament women — Tamar, Rahab, Ruth — mentioned in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus. And always Mary, whose faith and courage made her the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to focus on the men around Jesus: the genealogies, the shepherds, the wise men, the apostles. But the physicality of the Incarnation demands that women be a part of the story, and indeed we see women present from the manger to the cross to the resurrection, with Jesus at every key moment of the gospel story.</p>

<p>Jesus may have become God incarnate as a human man, but from Mary onward we never see Jesus treat women as anything less than co-heirs of his kingdom, equally created in the image of God. This is especially important because western civilization from before Jesus' time all the way through to ours has devalued bodies and women, elevating men and reason instead.</p>

<p>Patriarchy has been prevalent for most of human history, it seems — one of the first sins out of Eden. But in Greek culture, patriarchy combined with Platonism led to the association of women with the body and men with the mind. This association has morphed over the last two and a half millennia, but it still underlies assumptions about women: women are hormonal and emotional; women are vain and overly concerned with their bodies; women are less capable of logic and reason.</p>

<p>But the Incarnation upends these ideas about women and bodies: both are crucial to God&rsquo;s plan for redeeming and restoring humanity.</p>

<p>This is good news indeed for women.</p>

<p>At least in modern-day western culture (my own experience), women are constantly either told that their bodies are a problem or reduced to simply their bodies. The checkout lane at the supermarket shows both: discipline your body through diet and exercise — so that you can wield the power of a perfectly shaped body.</p>

<p>And we can&rsquo;t feel superior as Christians, since churches are seldom much better: purity culture, along with the even wider-spread Billy Graham (or Mike Pence) rule, frame women&rsquo;s bodies as inherently sinful, so tempting that they must be covered up and kept away from men. Additionally, churches that forbid women from holding leadership positions often do so with the argument that women are more easily deceived and less capable of leadership — code for being less rational than men.</p>

<p>We should certainly question the association of women with the body, since men are no less embodied and women are no less rational. But devaluing women tends to accompany devaluing bodies, and the Incarnation directly challenges both by elevating women and bodies.</p>

<p>What does this mean for women today, that Jesus came into the world through the body of a faithful woman?</p>

<p>It means that the process of childbirth is important labor, and ought to be valued and respected rather than regarded as an inconvenience to employers and the non-pregnant.</p>

<p>It means that women are more than their physicality, and especially more than their sexuality: Mary&rsquo;s body was important, but equally important was her faith, her consent to bear the son of God.</p>

<p>It means that women are not dangerous temptresses incapable of not seducing men; instead, they are companions to Jesus and vital workers in his kingdom from the time of the patriarchs through the present day.</p>

<p>It means that women, like men, are fully created in the image of God with all the privileges and responsibilities of such a high position within creation.</p>

<p>The Incarnation is good news for all, since God loved his creation enough to become part of that creation. And for women, devalued, sexualized, reduced to their bodies, the Incarnation is very good news indeed.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 2 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a></em></p>

<p>Several years ago, my husband and I were part of a small group that watched <em>The Truth Project</em>, a video series produced by Focus on the Family. I have plenty of varied critiques of the material, but one phrase — often repeated by the main presenter — has stuck with me: he asked what the world would look like if we &ldquo;really believed&rdquo; what we claim to believe.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the phrase is that earnest mental commitment to a set of beliefs will, inevitably, change the way we live. But notice the emphasis: we need to work harder to <strong>believe</strong> the right things, to &ldquo;really&rdquo; believe. The orthodoxy (right beliefs) must, in this view, precede the orthopraxy (right doing).</p>

<p>But what does that mean? And why so much emphasis on our mental state?</p>

<p>Protestant theology in particular has a history of emphasizing salvation by grace through faith, rather than through works (although orthodox Christianity in all forms affirms that only Christ can bring about salvation). Additionally, Protestant theology was deeply entwined with Renaissance humanism, the sweeping intellectual movement running alongside the Reformation.</p>

<p>This intellectual grounding, plus a desire to avoid works-based theologies, meshed with the ever-present Platonism of western culture that values the mind (the metaphysical) over the body (the physical). And this results in a strain of Christianity that emphasizes right thinking, right believing, over all else.</p>

<p>In this vision of Christianity, the most crucial thing is to have the right mental furniture arranged in the right mental order. No papers scattered on the coffee table, no comfy but ugly couches, no chairs sitting askew; our intellectual house must be in order.</p>

<p>I confess, I like tidy mental systems and neat intellectual arguments; I want my mental faith furniture to have good feng shui, if I may be permitted a mixed metaphor. Clearly, what we believe shapes how we live in significant ways.</p>

<p>And yet. Can Christianity really be primarily about mental furniture? About the strength of our intellectual beliefs?</p>

<p>I think that the Incarnation gives a resounding NO to that question. God&rsquo;s great love for us was not only spiritual or metaphysical: love took on human flesh, <em>suffering</em> human flesh, in the person of Jesus Christ. Love became incarnate, became tangible, carried by a poor teenage girl and born in the lowliest of places. If the greatest expression of God&rsquo;s love required a human body, how can we return and reflect that love apart from our bodies?</p>

<p>One of the most sobering passages in the bible is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. Here, Jesus envisions final judgment, saying to the righteous:</p>

<blockquote><p>For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p></blockquote>

<p>James tells us that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14-26&amp;version=NIV">faith without works is dead</a>; Paul tells us that all the spiritual accomplishments in the world <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">are nothing without love</a>. We can really believe all we want, but until that belief becomes love and takes on flesh, becoming embodied in the world, all that belief is meaningless. The intellectual furniture matters only inasmuch as it becomes embodied in food for the hungry, clothes for the needy, company for the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> believe in God all the time. Some days, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to look at the wrongs of the world and believe that a good God is somehow present. Some days, the hope of resurrection seems like a beautiful but impossible dream. Some days, my prayers hover in the corner of my ceiling and seem to vanish into nothingness.</p>

<p>But forcing myself into some sort of intellectual certainty doesn&rsquo;t help on those days. What helps? Drinking coffee with a friend. Cuddling with a blanket, a book, and a child. Taking a meal to new parents. Opening my home to giggling 8-year-olds and their math homework. Volunteering with an organization that helps the hurting. Jesus tells us to love God and love others: how can we do that if we don&rsquo;t embody love, incarnate love?</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s love became a man, became a body, became relationships and shared tears and physical touch, broken bread and blood spilled out like wine. Our theology must reflect this, must include the body as well as the mind.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Paul, if I have the most perfectly arranged mental furniture but I never turn those beliefs into action, I have nothing. If the greatest love of all must become flesh, how can I respond except by incarnating my love in physical actions?</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 1 of an Advent series on incarnation.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday began the season of Advent, the weeks of anticipation and longing leading up to the celebration of Christmas. In these days before Christmas we recall the longing for the Messiah, fulfilled with the birth of Christ, and remind ourselves that we are still longing for the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. Much like Lent, Advent reminds us that we need a savior — and that our savior has come, born in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Advent is about the longing, about the hope of a candle lit against the darkness. It&rsquo;s also about the fact that Christ has come, that he was born to a woman in a particular time and place, that God dwelt amongst humanity. Advent is about incarnation: both the Incarnation, God become human, and incarnation, the fact of our physical bodies and the longing for the restoration of God&rsquo;s very good creation.</p>

<p>When we sing about sweet baby Jesus, silent in the manger, or when we set up our sanitized nativities, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the breathtaking reality of incarnation. Not only did God become a human being, but God did so in the most messy, most human way possible: childbirth.</p>

<p>What a breathtaking affirmation of the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<p>In my experience, we modern western Christians are not particularly good at thinking about the material creation. We are heirs not just to Christianity but also to Plato — whose articulation of the separation between the illusory material world and real world of ideal forms undergirds centuries of philosophy. Plato&rsquo;s conception of a reality beyond the material world meshes in many ways with Christianity, but with the unfortunate side effect of elevating the spiritual above the physical.</p>

<p>Elevating the spiritual or metaphysical over the material or physical is especially easy because of the way that sin has marred the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation. We develop arthritis, catch colds, fight cancer, experience heart failure. We often view our bodies as limitations, as weights that hold the true us (whatever that may be) back from fulfilling our potential.</p>

<p>But when we denigrate our physical bodies, we forget that when God made humankind and thus completed creation, God said that it — creation, the material world — was <strong>very</strong> good. And while sin may mar that goodness, it cannot erase it: our bodies were created very good, and will one day be recreated and restored to that goodness.</p>

<p>When God chose to come to earth as Jesus, he chose to take on the flesh that he had created. He chose to inhabit a physical body, to experience the joys and indignities of the body. And more, he chose to be born, to experience the fullness of human life from helpless baby, to unsteady toddler, to hormonal teenager, to suffering adult.</p>

<p>God didn&rsquo;t cheat, creating a body for himself out of nothing, or creating a perfect body. And the doctrine of the Incarnation says that his physical body wasn&rsquo;t just some shell, some avatar; rather, Jesus was fully human just as he was fully divine. Jesus&rsquo;s willingness to take on flesh shows a respect for and a profound love for the material body.</p>

<p>The Incarnation suggests that God redeems humanity not by separating the spiritual from the physical but by healing and integrating both. And so over the next three weeks, I&rsquo;ll be exploring what this means: how should the Incarnation shape our thinking about the material world, and our bodies in particular? What does it mean that the center of our theology is a God who willingly became human flesh? How do we live in the tension between the very good creation and the very real physical effects of sin?</p>

<p>The first candle in the Advent wreath is the prophecy candle, or the candle of hope. As we live in the tension between the promise and fulfillment, may the incarnation give us hope that all creation — material and immaterial — will ultimately be redeemed and once again made very good.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Wife of Bath and Dangerous Authority</title>

<p>&ldquo;Experience, rather than any authority in this world, is good enough for me to tell you about the woe that is marriage&rdquo;: so proclaims Chaucer&rsquo;s vivacious Wife of Bath in the opening lines of her <em>Prologue</em> in the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. She frames the conflict between experience and authority vividly as she contrasts her wide-ranging marital experience (five husbands) with the academic theological authorities on women and marriage. Although her concerns differ in some ways from ours today, the tension between her lived experience and the authoritative thinking on femininity remains familiar to women.</p>

<p>As the allegations of sexual assault and harassment keep rolling in, and more prominent men face the consequences (most recently, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2BvU35Q">Matt Lauer</a>), I am finding Chaucer&rsquo;s 600-year-old exploration of the dichotomy between authority and experience particularly relevant. His Wife of Bath, Alison, experiences — often painfully — the tension between the authorities about women and her own life as a woman. Alison is well aware of the received wisdom about women: women manipulate men and lie about cheating; they care only about their position and appearance; they cannot control their sexual appetites (this last characteristic has, since Chaucer&rsquo;s day, switched from women to men).</p>

<p>And the Wife of Bath doesn&rsquo;t deny this received wisdom, exactly. She brags about how she manipulated her first three husbands, all elderly and rich, in order to gain wealth — while lying about her extramarital affairs. She unabashedly seeks social prominence, gained through her husbands' wealth. And she openly pursues her own sexual satisfaction in her fifth marriage.</p>

<p>But while authority describes the Wife of Bath, it cannot comprehend her lived experience. She tells us that she was first married at age 12: a surprisingly young age for even Chaucer&rsquo;s fourteenth-century readers, and an age at which the young Alison was completely at the mercy of authority — parents, guardians, husband. Of course Alison does what she can to gain some degree of power and autonomy, using the only tools she&rsquo;s ever been given.</p>

<p>Authority also comes into more direct conflict with experience in Alison&rsquo;s fifth marriage, to Jankyn — her only named husband. She, wealthy now from the estates of her first three husbands, chooses the young Jankyn because she finds him sexually attractive. But unfortunately for her, Jankyn&rsquo;s hobby is reading the so-called antifeminist authorities: those church fathers who most venomously attack and condemn women as uniquely sinful, the cause of all evil in the world from Eve onward.</p>

<p>In a scene worthy of any sitcom, Jankyn sits by the fire reading these authorities to his wife. She, unable to bear any more, rips the pages from the book and tosses them into the fire; Jankyn knocks her down in a rage. But when he sees that he has hurt his wife, he is overcome with repentance and the two reconcile — burning his antifeminist book.</p>

<p>Although Chaucer plays this scene for comedic effect, he also highlights the interplay between authority and experience. Jankyn&rsquo;s affinity for a certain type of authority leads him to treat his wife badly, haranguing her with readings on her inadequacies as a woman and even physically abusing her. These authorities can&rsquo;t remain abstract: they are inevitably reflected in experience. And Alison&rsquo;s experience suggests that these antifeminist authorities are dangerous to women precisely because they do not attempt to understand how their arguments affect the actual lived experience of women.</p>

<p>So how does this 600-year-old story connect to this particular moment, in which men are facing a reckoning as women collectively voice the pain of years of harassment and abuse?</p>

<p>In our society — both broadly and within the church — received authority tells us that men want sex, while women do emotions. It tells us that boys will be boys — and if you want to play with the boys, you have to learn not to cry. It tells us that women manipulate men sexually and that women lie, so their stories about assault are always suspect.</p>

<p>Women have known, have <em>experienced</em>, the consequences of these beliefs for decades. All too often, however, these experiences, because they conflict with the authority of cultural beliefs, have been denied and suppressed. And it&rsquo;s not just men who do these: we women do it to ourselves when we downplay and justify our experiences. (NPR&rsquo;s Kat Chow has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/25/565729334/gaslighting-how-a-flicker-of-self-doubt-warps-our-response-to-sexual-harassment">a brilliant article</a> on this topic.) Sometimes, especially in the church, we do this in response to overt authority; other times, it&rsquo;s under the pressure of cultural authority.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re witnessing a moment of experience talking back to authority: when we let &ldquo;boys be boys&rdquo; (code for bad behavior), we let them harm women. When we paint women as emotional at best, manipulative at worst, we make it impossible for them to hold men accountable for their actions. When we accept harassment as the price for workplace success, we condemn women to an extra burden of stress and discomfort in their jobs.</p>

<p>Ideas have consequences. Authority shapes experience. And authority that cannot acknowledge experience, cannot adapt when it produces harmful experience, is dangerous.</p>

<p>I love Chaucer because of the way he explodes binary oppositions — the Wife of Bath sets up authority and experience as opposites, but as we see in her tale they are inextricably linked. Chaucer demonstrates that problems arise when that link goes only one direction, from authority to experience; experience should also inform authority.</p>

<p>Changes to received wisdom are always slow. But as the experience of hundreds and thousands of women comes to painful light, I hope it will reshape our authorities on women. Women cannot thrive in a society that suppresses their experiences and refuses to let those experiences reshape our ideas.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/why-liberty-university-banned-an-anti-trump-christian-author-from-campus/544571/">News broke</a> at the beginning of November that Liberty University had Christian pastor and author Jonathan Martin escorted off the campus while he attended a concert at the invitation of the performers. Martin&rsquo;s offense? Officially, arranging to pray informally with students the next morning without obtaining the necessary permissions. Unofficially, criticizing Falwell for his support of Trump.</p>

<p>Although I find plenty of room for criticism in Liberty&rsquo;s actions, as a private university they are within their rights to exclude whomever they please. But their ban on Martin raises, yet again, the question of what the university is for: the free exchange of idea or the promotion of a particular point of view? Christian institutions like Liberty face the even more complicated question of how to engage with a wide range of ideas while remaining faithful to their core convictions.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at a Christian college, then graduate student and instructor at a large research university for ten years, then tenure-track faculty at a small Christian college for another four, I have wrestled with this question of what the university is for, and especially the Christian university. Over the past several years, the world of higher ed has struggled with the issue of how to engage with divisive ideas — a struggle that has broken into wider public consciousness periodically as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/us/middlebury-college-charles-murray-bell-curve-protest.html?_r=0">students protest</a> speakers they find objectionable.</p>

<p>Every society draws lines around acceptable and unacceptable ideas. At the most basic level, societies have taboos — those actions that are considered unthinkable and unforgivable, like incest. But often, what is acceptable shifts: a century ago, talking about &ldquo;inferior races&rdquo; was acceptable; today, most westerners find the idea deeply disturbing. Much of the problem facing universities today lies not in spoiled undergraduates but in shifting ideas about where we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable ideas, and who gets to decide where that line falls.</p>

<p>While the question of who gets to draw the lines gets much attention, I think we also need to ask how we can maintain a commitment to certain ideals in the face of opposing arguments. How can a university balance a commitment to valuing all humans equally with a commitment to understanding the ideas that have shaped history, even the ones that now seem abhorrent to us?</p>

<p>Back in the seventeenth century, the poet and thinker John Milton wrote an essay titled &ldquo;Areopagitica,&rdquo; in which he argues for the free exchange of ideas. Milton lived through the English Civil War, a war fought over conflicting ideas about religion and government. But despite the violence that he witnessed as ideas came into conflict, Milton argues for freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas. He is not naive about the potential dangers; he knows that ideas have power and that wrong ideas can be seductive. But Milton still argues passionately against censorship.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For Milton, people cannot be truly educated, cannot truly know what is good, if they are only exposed to a limited set of ideas chosen by a limited set of gatekeepers. And although Milton&rsquo;s argument was not accepted by the short-lived English Commonwealth, his notions of the free distribution of ideas undergird modern ideas about freedom of the press.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Every society, and thus every system of higher education, will have its orthodoxies and the desire to protect those orthodoxies. And the risk of the free circulation of ideas is that people may be seduced by the evil ideas, or the ones outside the accepted orthodoxy — some of which may be not so much evil as simply different.</p>

<p>In my experience, the university — Christian or secular — functions at its best when it strives to understand its orthodoxies while also giving students the freedom to explore contrary ideas. Having commitments to certain values is a good thing, but that does not mean that we should censor anything outside those values. This balance, however, can be difficult to find; it is thus not at all surprising that in a time of social change some find comfort in clinging to old orthodoxies while refusing to acknowledge contrary ideas.</p>

<p>The irony is hard to miss when a school named &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; errs on the side of rejecting those outside of its orthodoxy, rather than permitting the free exchange of ideas. But it&rsquo;s worth taking this moment to consider the responsibility of Christian higher education: when an educational institution stops allowing dissenting voices, is it still educating? And is the goal of a Christian university to educate or to defend?</p>

<p>I think that the value of education far outweighs the risk of dangerous ideas. But we have to be willing to take the risk in order to gain the reward, and this is the dilemma that faces the university.</p>

<p>The past year has been a challenging one for me. Eleven months ago, after much agonizing, I decided to leave my job teaching English at a small Christian college in Tennessee. And more, I decided not to keep looking for another academic job if I didn&rsquo;t get one during the 2016-17 job season. Five years on the academic job market had made my soul weary, and I even though I love my field I couldn&rsquo;t continue to put myself through that process.</p>

<p>So I quit my job, and when another job offer never materialized I moved with my family back to the Chicago area. It&rsquo;s been a disorienting season in many ways, although I&rsquo;m writing — this blog among other things — and slowly stretching into new ideas about my future.</p>

<p>But this is Thanksgiving, and in the midst of all the transitions of the last year I have much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;m thankful to those of you reading this blog. Thanks for your support, and keep sharing posts you like with others who may appreciate them!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my former students, who challenged me to be a careful reader and clear communicator, and who indulged my nerdy enthusiasm for books and words.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to my former colleagues for their warm and generous support, for wise advice, letters of recommendation, and sour cream donuts from Dunkin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for our friends in Tennessee, who loved us even as we left them and supported us in our move.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for old friends who welcomed us back to the Chicago area, and fed us and watched our kids while we unloaded and unpacked boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who have so generously welcomed us into our new church, making us feel at home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for my husband, who worked tirelessly to set up this website and who has been encouraging and supportive during this transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my daughters, who remind me to laugh and play and drink hot cocoa on chilly afternoons.</p>

<p>I hope that all of you have good food and good company and many things to be thankful for this year. And for those of you who have struggled this year or who find Thanksgiving difficult, may you have a day of peace.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>]]></description>

<p>In one of those pieces of serendipity, a few weeks ago I heard the Liturgists' podcast titled <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2017/10/17/god-our-mother-live-from-boston">&ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo;</a>, featuring Christina Cleveland, and I read Katelyn Beaty&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2017/october/why-i-continue-to-call-god-father.html"><em>CT Women</em> post</a> on why she continues to use masculine pronouns for God. This question about the language we use for God is one I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last few years, especially as I&rsquo;ve come to see the value of gender-inclusive language in the bible.</p>

<p>For several years, I used the ESV translation of the bible. The more traditional language, especially in the Psalms, resonated with me — probably linked to the fact that the literary chair for the translation, Dr. Leland Ryken, was one of my first literature professors; he laid the foundation for my deep love of seventeenth-century British poets. But the steadfast refusal of the translators to use gender-inclusive language bothered me more and more as I read.</p>

<p>Most egregiously, as pointed out by Rebecca Card-Hyatt <a href="http://juniaproject.com/footnoted-bible-written-for-men-part-1/">on the <em>Junia Project</em> blog</a>, the translators chose to render the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em> in the New Testament as &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; a choice consistent with centuries of tradition. However, the translators footnote each instance with these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Or brothers and sisters. The plural Greek word adelphoi (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, adelphoi may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the translators reject the inclusive language that Paul himself uses in favor of traditional language.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read widely in English literature, and I do understand that often (although not always) the terms &ldquo;men,&rdquo; &ldquo;mankind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; are used to include women as well. However, language shifts; in modern-day English, it&rsquo;s no longer considered acceptable to use &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a stand-in for &ldquo;everyone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; as the equivalent of &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo; But the translators of the ESV simultaneously acknowledge and reject this fact by using &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in the text but including the footnote that the word means both brothers and sisters. The translators choose exclusive, rather than inclusive, language on the basis of tradition without considering how this comes across to those excluded — namely, the women of the church.</p>

<p>So I switched translations, to the 2011 NIV. The Psalms aren&rsquo;t quite as melodious, but I don&rsquo;t feel intentionally excluded when I read the New Testament; that&rsquo;s a trade-off I&rsquo;m willing to make.</p>

<p>Thinking about gender-inclusive language in the case of a word like <em>adelphoi</em> has broadened into thinking about the language I use for God. I grew up using exclusively masculine language for God: God the Father, God the Son, God the warrior, God the bearded creator of Michelangelo&rsquo;s Sistine Chapel. And I do affirm that Jesus was made incarnate as a man, which makes the use of masculine imagery for God even easier to accept.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>Jesus may have been incarnated as a man, but God is a spirit, or a being who defies human categories, yes? If God doesn&rsquo;t have a beard, God also doesn&rsquo;t have male anatomy. And if God created both men and women in the image of God, God must incorporate both male and female; neither male nor female can claim to be the better representation of God.</p>

<p>Beyond the creation narrative, the bible uses both masculine and feminine imagery to communicate the nature and character of God.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> God comforts like a mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+66:12-13&amp;version=NIV">Is. 66:12-13</a>), longs to gather us as a hen gathers her chicks (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:37&amp;version=NIV">Mt. 23:37</a>), and we relate to God as a weaned child to its mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+131:2&amp;version=NIV">Ps. 131:2</a>), among other images. And in the parables about the kingdom of heaven, Jesus gives us the image of a woman searching for a lost coin alongside the shepherd searching for a lost sheep, using both a man and a woman as analogues for the God who longs to recover us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15&amp;version=NIV">Luke 15</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, God prohibited the ancient Hebrews from using images of God in worship; this sets them apart from the surrounding people groups who located power in physical idols, but it also has the interesting result of preventing the Hebrews from giving God physical shape, including a physical sex.</p>

<p>And yet, anyone who affirms a historical Jesus must acknowledge that he was incarnated as a man. Moreover, in the process of the incarnation God the Father is indeed the father. I don&rsquo;t want to push the biology of the incarnation too far, but given human reproductive systems God must be the father rather than the mother of Jesus. Building on Jesus as human man and God as his father, the church has historically used masculine pronouns for God and tended to conceive of God as male.</p>

<p>Envisioning God as male has had the unfortunate side effect, however, of making women seem less fully created in the image of God. A male God combined with ancient Greek medical science that saw women as mis-formed men has fed patriarchal social structures and negative views of women. In order to combat patriarchal structures that subtly demean women, we need to remember that God is not a man, is not constrained to human categories of gender or biological sex.</p>

<p>But how do we do that?</p>

<p>One answer is to use feminine pronouns and titles for God. In the Liturgists' podcast &ldquo;God our Mother,&rdquo; Michael Gungor rewrites well-known hymns to address God as a woman: this is our Mother&rsquo;s world. This phrasing feels jarring to me, but it also opens up new ways of thinking about God. Also, the discomfort I feel with saying &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; reminds me that I should feel similar discomfort with &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo;: neither can fully encompass who God is, while both can offer valuable (and biblical) insights into the nature of God.</p>

<p>In her <em>CT Women</em> article, however, Katelyn Beaty pushes back against using female language for God. She begins by arguing that for every person who struggles to accept the idea of God as a good father, there&rsquo;s someone who would struggle to accept God as a good mother. This point is true, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense as a defense of calling God &ldquo;father;&rdquo; rather, it acknowledges the limitations of using any human metaphors to describe God.</p>

<p>Beaty also argues that calling God by neutral terms — creator, redeemer — risks de-personalizing God, making God an abstract rather than a relational being. This is an interesting point: I&rsquo;m not completely convinced that this necessitates the use use of masculine terms, but &ldquo;father&rdquo; is a much more personal relationship than &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; a term that may invoke a distant deistic god (or perhaps the dysfunction of a Dr. Frankenstein).</p>

<p>Although Beaty concludes that the church should continue to use masculine language for God, while encouraging men to fully reflect God by treating women as equals, I think her most important point is that God is a <em>relational</em> God. God wants to be known by us, but we humans can only understand God through metaphor and image; even the Incarnation gave us God mediated through human physicality.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; podcast, Christina Cleveland rather tartly argues that of course people should be able to use masculine language for God; for some, this is the best way to understand who God is. And if God is relational, if God wants to be known by us, surely God understands when we use language that helps us to enter into a relationship with God — after all, no human language can ever adequately describe God. But if we accept this argument, then we must also allow people to approach God as the woman searching for a coin, not just as the good (male) shepherd; as the hovering mother hen, not just the strong warrior&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best approach is to embrace the variety of images and terms for God we find in the bible. Not every metaphor will resonate with every Christian, but that&rsquo;s not the point; if one metaphor could explain the nature of God and the Kingdom of heaven, Jesus would only have needed to tell one parable. Embracing variety will also remind us that God is above our human categories of gender and biological sex. We may pray &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo; in our liturgies, but we can also embrace the image of God as our Mother.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve challenged myself in this blog post to not use pronouns for God. This feels awkward; I&rsquo;ve typed and deleted &ldquo;his&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; more times than I care to count. But it&rsquo;s also liberating: if God is a man, I can&rsquo;t be created in his image. But if God is mother along with creator, redeemer, protector and father, I can better relate to and reflect that God. Just like reading &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; in Paul&rsquo;s letters, seeing the feminine attributes of God reminds me that I am fully created in the image of God and fully a part of the church and the coming kingdom of God.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; and &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; rather imprecisely here, since these culturally-determined traits can shift. Modern-day America, for example, associates weeping with femininity, but historically this hasn&rsquo;t always been true.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
