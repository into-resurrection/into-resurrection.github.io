<p>The day after Valentine&rsquo;s Day seems like a good time to contemplate the death of chivalry, no? So settle down with your discount chocolate and let us determine whether or not we should deposit our roses upon the grave of chivalry.</p>

<p>We must begin with the fact that medieval chivalry is indeed dead. Deceased. No more. Pining for the fjords.</p>

<p>The chivalry that arose in the middle ages was a warrior code for the <em>chevalrie,</em> or mounted knights. During the middle ages, because the armored knight on horseback was both the most effective and most expensive battle technology, these elite warriors came from the class with money: the nobility. Chivalry developed as a warrior code for these noble warriors, who were a powerful but small group within medieval society.</p>

<p>There is no single code of chivalry, as chivalry existed for several centuries in multiple distinct cultural contexts across Europe. But broadly, the ideals of chivalry encompassed strength on the battlefield (prowess), good manners and wise counsel (courtesy), and devotion to God and the Church (piety).</p>

<p>Beneath these three pillars, however, the purpose of chivalry was to simultaneously <em>control</em> and <em>legitimize</em> violence. It controlled violence by setting rules about how to interact with others of the same class on the battlefield (rules that did not apply to fighters from lower classes). But it also legitimized violence by requiring that the nobility prove their chivalry through violence, preferably war but tournaments or hunting if necessary.</p>

<p>So, to recap: chivalry was a warrior code that applied to men in the medieval nobility. While chivalry included many characteristics and ideals, the one non-negotiable constant remained violence. Chivalry seems a little less romantic put this way.</p>

<p>So how did chivalry become romanticized?</p>

<p>We can blame the Romantics of the nineteenth century. After the middle ages gave way to the early modern period, chivalry morphed into the polish of the courtier and separated from warrior elites, since mounted knights became an obsolete battle technology by the end of the middle ages. Violence remained an important marker of masculinity, displayed in wars and in duels, but chivalry as a social code all but disappeared.</p>

<p>However, in the nineteenth century, the Romantics began seeking alternatives to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. They turned to the middle ages and, well, romanticized them, creating the middle ages of <em>The Idylls of the King</em> and <em>Ivanhoe</em> and innumerable pre-Raphaelite paintings of knights and ladies.</p>

<p>As imagined by writers like Alfred Tennyson and Sir Walter Scott, chivalry is no longer focused on violence practiced by a warrior elite but on virtue and courtesy. Romance takes center stage, and the central aspect of courtesy becomes courtesy to women.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Violence still plays a role as a vital part of masculinity, but the recreated chivalry of the nineteenth century interacts with idealized, fictional violence with clear divisions between good and evil.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Like medieval chivalry, however, this romanticized chivalry still applies only to men. It extends beyond noble men, and might sometimes democratically confer nobility of character upon the chivalrous man, but women are still the <em>objects</em> of chivalry, never its possessors.</p>

<p>When people discuss the death of chivalry, they mean this reimagined chivalry, a chivalry that arose in literature rather than in communities. And they imagine it has been killed by a lack of good manners in today&rsquo;s youth, or perhaps by joyless feminists, or hook-up culture, or whatever someone thinks makes the present worse than the past.</p>

<p>In other words, chivalry today is always nostalgic for an idealized past in which men were noble and women were compliant. This nostalgia erases those who could not, because of their socio-economic status, be chivalrous: people of color (too savage, for the Victorian, to be chivalrous); poor people (too unrefined to be chivalrous); or women who work (clearly not worthy objects of chivalry). The nostalgia instead elevates the desires of a certain class of men to feel noble and to demonstrate their superiority through displays of chivalry to each other and to deserving women.</p>

<p>Medieval chivalry served a social purpose, even if from our modern-day point of view we can see its limitations. Nineteenth-century chivalry was nostalgic from the start, serving an escapist purpose and creating a sense of social superiority.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>To be clear, I think that basic courtesy is an important element of society. I appreciate it when people hold doors or let someone else go first. I teach my children the courtesy phrases: thank you, excuse me, have a nice day. But these small daily courtesies can and should be practiced by anyone; they do not signal status but a basic respect for others.</p>

<p>Chivalry, by contrast, signals status and a certain self-conception, and in all of its incarnations men are the practitioners of chivalry, women its recipients. Some might argue that women benefit from chivalry, and in some limited ways that is true. But those benefits come at the cost of full participation in society and at the cost of expected passivity and constant receptiveness to chivalrous gestures, whether women want those gestures or not.</p>

<p>I hope I don&rsquo;t need to enumerate the problems that arise when a society expects women to be passive and powerless.</p>

<p>Chivalry isn&rsquo;t dead, but engrained in the sexism, racism and classism in American society. But maybe it is slowly dying, replaced by a more egalitarian respect between genders.</p>

<p>And when its death finally comes, I will be first in line to lay my roses on the grave of chivalry.</p>

<p>How should we understand salvation? For centuries, theologians have considered this question, proposing various soteriological models and analogies that help us grasp what Christ did on the cross and how he did it. Any model has strengths and weaknesses and more or less relevance in specific cultural contexts, but each analogy can help us to gain new insight into how Christ accomplished our salvation.</p>

<p>Among American evangelicals, the prominent — and sometimes the only — model of salvation is penal substitutionary atonement. In this model, God is a divine judge who has sentenced humans to eternal death and damnation because of their sins. However, Jesus steps in and takes that penalty upon himself, paying it so that we humans don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>This analogy for salvation arose with the Reformation, an era in which the individual became ascendant over the community and in which new legal theories arose. Penal substitutionary atonement reworked the older satisfaction model, developed by the theologian Anselm in the eleventh century. In the satisfaction analogy, God like a feudal ruler has been offended by the sinfulness of humanity, but humans are so far beneath God as to be incapable of offering satisfaction for this offense. Enter Jesus, the God-Man: as a human, he can step forward to offer satisfaction, and as God, he is actually capable of doing so.</p>

<p>Anselm&rsquo;s satisfaction theory emphasizes Christ&rsquo;s humanity, which had been less prominent in the previous dominant model, known as <em>Christus Victor</em> theology. In this analogy, Christ is a warrior who comes to rescue humanity from the devil, sin, evil and death. <em>Christus Victor</em> soteriology captures the upside-down logic of the cross, in which the battered and dying man is really the king of the world who can defeat the forces of evil and rescue his creation.</p>

<p>Several other models of salvation exist, although the three described above are perhaps the most prevalent in western Christianity (I can&rsquo;t speak to the soteriology of the eastern church, unfortunately). Each model finds scriptural grounding, while also reflecting broader cultural values about leadership, laws and individuals.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time outlining these ideas so that I can talk about <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/penal-substitutionary-atonement-it-doesnt-get-more-personal.html?share=">one specific article</a>, written by Mark Galli of <em>Christianity Today</em>, that defends penal substitutionary atonement as the primary soteriological model that evangelicals should use. Evangelicals have debated the place of this model for at least a decade, with some <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/penal-substitutionary-atonement-necessary/">expressing reservations</a> and others calling this model <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/thoughtlife/2017/06/substitutionary-atonement-necessary-evangelical-faith/">inseparable from the gospel itself.</a> Galli holds a moderate position in this debate: while he argues that penal substitutionary atonement should be the primary evangelical model of salvation, he grants the usefulness of other soteriological theories.</p>

<p>Galli does make some flawed arguments. Several are minor, largely reflecting the pervasive evangelical blindspots towards cultural context and history; he tends to universalize and generalize as he suggests that the argument for penal substitutionary atonement rooted in modern western legal theory is actually an intuitively obvious position across time and culture.</p>

<p>But the largest problem with the article comes at the very end. In his concluding paragraph, Galli states:</p>

<blockquote><p>It [penal substitutionary atonement] is the one atonement model more than the others that reminds us of the personal investment of God in each one of us. Where <em>Christus Victor</em>, for example, is a wonderful model to describe cosmic redemption, substitutionary atonement is about my salvation: Christ died for me. It doesn’t get any more personal than that. And evangelical religion is nothing if not personal.</p></blockquote>

<p>To paraphrase: penal substitutionary atonement should be central because this model <em>elevates the individual above all.</em></p>

<p>I want to be clear that I certainly agree that God is a personal God, concerned with us on an individual level, who desires to be in relationship with us.</p>

<p>But when we reduce salvation to the personal we distort the nature of sin.</p>

<p>Sin is significantly bigger than the wrongdoing of any single individual. Sin manifests in broken relationships — between us and God, us and others, us and the natural world. Sin can be personal, as when I angrily snap at a child or harbor envy of a colleague. But sin can also be corporate, as when a church protects abusers at the expense of the abused, or structural, as when societies systematically oppress a group of people.</p>

<p>Sin affects our relationship to the natural world, leading to the exploitations of nature that poison streams and cause animal populations to collapse.</p>

<p>Sin corrupts our relationships with others, prompting colonialism and patriarchy and racism and other problems far larger than any individual.</p>

<p>A focus on personal sin foregrounds individual wrongdoing and pushes the broader scope of redemption into the background. But through Christ, God is redeeming the whole world, making all creation new. Suffering will end, justice will come, and all of the created world (human and inhuman) will be redeemed and renewed. All the broken relationships will be restored.</p>

<p></figure></p>

<p>But in addition to making the scope of salvation smaller, a focus on individual sin allows communities of Christians to ignore other forms of sin. God does redeem our individual sins, but as John Donne noted, no one is an island. Our sins ripple out into our families, our communities, our environment, and God is also redeeming those effects. When churches focus on God&rsquo;s forgiveness for individuals, they often skip the part where communities, not just individuals, need to be made whole.</p>

<p>Racism is one obvious example of the ways in which a focus on individual sin can make the larger effects of sin invisible. If racism is reduced to individual bigotry, the solution is merely individual: all that is necessary is to stop being prejudiced against a certain group of people — and if we trip up, God has already forgiven us. This approach has not worked particularly well in the church, which remains highly segregated.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Only a recognition of sin as broader than any single individual, of sin as manifested in structures of power and privilege, can begin to address the problem of racism.</p>

<p>Another example comes from the #metoo and #churchtoo movements in which women are speaking out about the ways they have been sexually assaulted, harassed and abused. While Hollywood is having a moment of reckoning, churches seem to be much less willing to grapple with the consequences of sexual abuse. Witness the standing ovation when pastor <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/january/andy-savages-standing-ovation-was-heard-round-world-because.html">Andy Savage</a> apologized for assaulting a teenager; witness the <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2018/february/sovereign-grace-rachael-denhollander-sgm-abuse-ct-interview.html?share=">defensive response of Sovereign Grace Ministries</a> to gymnast Rachael Denhollander, who after abuse by Larry Nassar became an advocate for victims of sexual assault in the church.</p>

<p>Viewing sin as purely individual separates sin from the power structures that can enable it, and prevents critical evaluation of those structures. And viewing sin as individual can lead to a greater concern for the sinner than for their victims, as with Andy Savage. Because he apologized, and because of course God forgives him, any lingering pain on the part of the woman he assaulted becomes not a consequence of <em>his</em> sin but a manifestation of <em>her</em> sin, her presumed resentment and lack of forgiveness. This view of sin wants to deny its larger consequences in favor of a simplistic narrative of individual repentance and forgiveness, to the detriment of all of those wounded by the sins of others.</p>

<p>To come back to soteriology: our doctrines of salvation are intimately tied to our ideas about sin. Penal substitutionary atonement certainly emphasizes individual salvation — Jesus took <em>my</em> place, <em>my</em> punishment — and this is true. But Jesus also died for <em>our</em> sins, to reconcile <em>all things</em> to God, and so we must remember that salvation is far bigger than any individual. Making penal substitutionary atonement central reflects the values of our individualistic culture. Any model of salvation will reflect the culture in which it arises; this is not necessarily wrong.</p>

<p>It only becomes wrong when it pushes out understandings of communal salvation and communal sin.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January, John Piper argued that <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/is-there-a-place-for-female-professors-at-seminary">women should not teach in seminaries.</a> While I vehemently disagree with Piper&rsquo;s position, it does flow logically from the complementarian position that does not allow women to have personal, direct authority over men — and especially not authority over men who will become church authorities.</p>

<p>The problem with Piper&rsquo;s argument, though, always comes down to how to draw the boundaries: if women can&rsquo;t pastor, then it follows that they can&rsquo;t teach seminary;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but what about college-level theology to students who don&rsquo;t intend to become pastors? What about Sunday School teachers, or the mothers of sons — at what point do they stop instructing young men? In other words, why do complementarians draw the lines they do?</p>

<p>I had never considered that question until I was in college, taking a required theology class that was taught by a woman. Although I grew up complementarian and was, at the time, opposed to women pastors, I never questioned the ethics of women as theology professors — just as I never questioned the ethics of women teaching any other subject.</p>

<p>However, this particular professor made a comment that stuck with me. I don&rsquo;t remember the context; perhaps we were discussing women in the church, but perhaps not. Regardless, my professor said that if she really believed that Paul forbade women from teaching men in the church in all circumstances, she would have to quit her job teaching theology at a Christian college.</p>

<p>This comment exposed a tension in my thinking that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before: why did I have no problem with a woman teaching theology to not only myself but my fellow male students, while I did have a problem with a woman preaching? Or, to rephrase the question, what exactly did Paul mean by teaching in 1 Timothy 2?</p>

<p>To be clear, many complementarians don&rsquo;t go as far as Piper, or may have reservations about women seminary professors but not women professors of bible and theology at an undergraduate level. After all, they argue, even a Christian college isn&rsquo;t a church; a professor doesn&rsquo;t take the same role as a pastor, or even a preacher.</p>

<p>But as disturbing as I find Piper&rsquo;s comments on women generally, and as encouraging as I&rsquo;ve found the responses (for example, <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/john-piper-needs-help-female-seminary-professors/">here</a> and <a href="http://amyfdavisabdallah.com/two-little-reminders/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/needed-women-seminary-professors-response-john-piper/">here</a>), Piper&rsquo;s position is logically consistent. Teaching Greek may not be the same as teaching homiletics, but I assume that the Greek taught in seminaries is not taught in a contextual void — at the very least, a woman Greek professor is teaching men how to read and handle scripture and she clearly has authority over them in the context of their theological education.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s my point?</p>

<p>Modern-day complementarianism, as propagated through organizations like the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, has an unresolved tension at its core. Most complementarians distance themselves from straight-up patriarchy, arguing that women are equal in value to men, fully created in the image of God. They merely have different <em>roles</em>, which largely means that women are excluded from certain teaching and leadership roles in the church. (I&rsquo;m addressing complementarianism in the church here; complementarianism in marriage has a different set of problems.)</p>

<p>But the problem always is: from what roles are women excluded? Senior pastor? Elder? Adult Sunday school teacher? Reader? Usher? Leadership council? Children&rsquo;s Sunday school teacher? College theology professor? Seminary professor? And embedded in this question is the deeper question of why the lines should be drawn in these ways. Why would a church allow women to serve on the leadership council and to teach adult Sunday school, but not to preach or function as senior pastor? What reasoning lies behind drawing the line at any particular point?</p>

<p>Both patriarchy and egalitarianism offer simplicity: patriarchy sees women as actually inferior to men, less fully created in the image of God, more susceptible to deception and emotionalism. Patriarchy can thus exclude women from any position of leadership, influence or power because it holds that they simply are not capable of the tasks associated with those positions. On the opposite side, egalitarians see women as the equal of men, just as capable and just as likely to be gifted and thus not barred from any role in the church.</p>

<p>Complementarians, however, must wrestle with how to treat women as beings created in God&rsquo;s image while also placing limitations on how they can serve and lead in the church. Some minimize those limitations, while others expand them, but regardless the scriptural basis for those limitations is shaky at best. Holding Paul&rsquo;s statement in 1 Timothy 2 about women not teaching or holding authority over men as universal, not specific to a particular situation in a particular church, leads to significant interpretive gymnastics when women can&rsquo;t lead churches but they can chair committees or lead small groups.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t change my mind about women in the church after my college theology course; that change in my thinking took several more years. But my professor planted a seed that day. I started asking why churches drew the lines they did around the roles of women, and asking on what basis they would draw those particular lines.</p>

<p>Along the way, I discovered that God doesn&rsquo;t fence me in with arbitrary lines, much less view me as a inferior version of men. God desires that I serve in my church and my community using my God-given gifts, whether those lead me to the nursery and kitchen or pulpit and lectern.</p>

<p>Thanks be to God.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>As several people have pointed out, part of the debate comes down to the purpose of seminary; Piper assumes that seminaries train pastors, but people without pastoral calls may also attend seminaries. This is an interesting debate, but it still splits hairs by implying that a woman professor teaching the same content is allowable in one set of circumstances (not preparing pastors) and not allowable in another (preparing pastors).<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>And not just interpretive gymnastics with 1 Timothy — women like the apostle Junia, the deacon Phoebe, and the teacher Priscilla also have to be explained away.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>During the season of Advent, I wrote about how the Incarnation is <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">good news for women</a> as it overturns the assumption that the mind (typically figured as masculine) is superior to the body (associated with the feminine). As I considered what woman to choose for a post on women in theology, I wanted to write about someone very aware of her ties to her physical body. While many women theologians could fit this criteria, Margery Kempe immediately sprang to mind.</p>

<p>Margery Kempe lived in England in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. She wrote (or more precisely, she dictated) the first autobiography in English — and one of the first autobiographies in western literature. Margery was a devout Christian, but not from early childhood (as <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-23-2017-catherine-of-siena">Catherine of Siena</a> was). Instead, Margery became devout after what seems like a period of postpartum psychosis after the birth of her first child.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Margery went on to have thirteen more children before convincing her husband to join her in a vow of chastity (understandably enough). But through these childbearing years, Margery engages in multiple forms of devotion from frequent prayers to pilgrimages to wearing a hair shirt (which her husband apparently never notices).</p>

<p>Her devotion is not unique for this period of history; the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Europe saw a flourishing of lay piety — that is, devotion practiced by ordinary people beyond the structures of the priesthood or monasticism. As the middle class grew in the late middle ages and became literate at least in their own vernaculars (even if not literate in Latin), the demand for devotional texts increased and loose communities of the devout formed. These Christians did not want to formally enter the church (as priests, monks or nuns) for a variety of reasons, but they did want to grow spiritually.</p>

<p>The institutional church had an uneasy relationship with these communities. Most people remained orthodox, some like Catherine of Siena affiliating themselves with monastic orders, but groups like the <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/review/book-review-wisdom-beguines">Beguines</a> faced accusations of heresy. Most significantly, in Margery Kempe&rsquo;s England a group of people called Lollards had begun following the teachings of John Wycliffe. The Lollards were declared heretical because of their views on the priesthood and the sacraments; they were also persecuted because of their political views.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>While the Lollards are a large and fascinating topic in their own right, most relevant to Margery is the fact that they encouraged itinerant preaching, even by women, to spread their beliefs. So when Margery began traveling and gaining a reputation as a holy women, her status as a middle-class (non-noble) woman outside the church meant that she faced considerable opposition from church authorities.</p>

<p>Margery faced resistance on two main fronts: her weeping and her teaching.</p>

<p>After the birth of her first child, Margery was afflicted or gifted (depending on your point of view) with weeping: when she contemplated the love of Christ and his suffering for her, she was unable to stop crying loudly. For Margery, this weeping was a gift from God, a sign of God&rsquo;s presence in and favor on her life. Weeping was a physical manifestation of her inner experience, and in her autobiography she repeatedly thanks God for allowing her to show her devotion in this physical way.</p>

<p>However, since she was often overcome with weeping in public places and particularly in holy places, church officials frequently chastised her. They believed that she could control her weeping but refused, preferring instead to draw attention to herself. Margery maintained that this was not the case: God caused her to weep, and she had no desire to make herself a public spectacle. Weeping, in all its messy physicality, became a point of tension between Margery and church authority.</p>

<p>But no matter how annoying some found her weeping, it was seldom the main complaint against her. Margery consistently faced opposition, often in the form of imprisonment and examination by church officials, for her teaching. In her account of her examination by the Archbishop of York, Margery carefully positions herself as a messenger of the gospel. She acknowledges that women cannot preach, but asserts that she has occupied no pulpit; she does use &ldquo;communication and good words&rdquo; to proclaim the gospel and argue against corruption in the church, but she claims that Jesus' interactions with women in scripture set a precedent for her to communicate the gospel.</p>

<p>The Archbishop, in Margery&rsquo;s account, can find no fault with this argument — but he still orders Margery to leave his diocese. This incident shows Margery as a participant in communities of lay people who gather to discuss the scripture and spur each other to live holy lives, communities in which women could and often did hold prominent positions as sources of advice and teaching. This incident with the Archbishop also shows the unease in the institutional church over the teachings and practices that may proliferate in such groups. Although Margery is not a Lollard, her willingness to criticize the church and teach her fellow lay Christians overlaps with heretical beliefs — and the existence of these heresies gives the church a reason to detain and question Margery.</p>

<p>But Margery persisted in her travels, her teaching and her weeping; she persisted through finding someone to write down her life;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> she persisted in telling her version of her spiritual life, no matter how unruly that life was in the eyes of the church. And above all, she persisted in asserting that she had received revelations from God.</p>

<p>Even today, it&rsquo;s easy to dismiss Margery Kempe as an attention-seeker, a hysterical woman, even a heretic. But she was also a woman who experienced God tangibly through her tears, an experience that propelled her to a life of devotion amongst a community of others seeking new ways to follow Christ.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>It&rsquo;s always dangerous to diagnose mental illness across cultures and at a distance of 600 years, but Margery&rsquo;s vivid description of her mental breakdown after the birth of her first child seems to show a case of not just postpartum depression but the much rarer postpartum psychosis.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>In short, the Lollards married Wycliffe&rsquo;s view that priests are not necessary intermediaries between the laity and God to the political views that spurred the Peasant Revolts. The Lollards thus challenged the established social order by arguing that neither priests nor kings are so God-ordained as to be above criticism and indeed revolt.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Margery was herself unable to write, although not necessarily unable to read; in the middle ages, reading and writing were distinct skill sets. She thus needed to hire someone to write her narrative. Her first scribe apparently wrote so poorly and in such an idiosyncratic dialect that few could read what he wrote; her second scribe promised to write for her, then backed out because of her tenuous standing with church authorities. This second man, however, referred her to yet a third man, who was able to better understand the first version and, with Margery&rsquo;s help, write the final version of her life.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>January has not been an easy month for me. My depression and anxiety have muted my days and turned my nights sleepless. I am so over the icy chill of midwestern winter mornings, and afternoons, and evenings; I crave the warmth of a muggy piedmont afternoon in North Carolina. I have old friends and new ones, but I miss the friends across the office hall and the students in my old classrooms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of much meaningful to write, or even do, when the weather is grey and the wind bites and the fog of depression and winter descends and blankets everything with a seemingly unending chill.</p>

<p>And so I turn to one of my fail-safe comforts: baking bread. Yesterday, I baked my weekly loaves of sandwich bread, but I also tried my hand at the braided challah bread pictured above. My family crowded into my tiny kitchen to watch and help in the process: my youngest daughter rolled dough with me into strands for the braid. My brother&rsquo;s girlfriend held my laptop at the right angle so I could watch and imitate a YouTube tutorial, while my brother and husband offered moral support as I struggled to master the six-strand braid. My older daughters oohed and aahed over the finished product.</p>

<p>I love the process of making bread. I love the feel of kneaded dough, supple and smooth. I love the magic of yeast, of the bread growing as a living organism. I love the chemistry of heat, transforming the soft pillow of dough into a beautifully browned loaf. I love that I have produced a tangible good in the world, turning flour and water and oil into something nourishing and delicious for my entire family.</p>

<p>Jesus uses <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13:33&amp;version=NIV">yeast worked through dough</a> as a <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+13:20-21&amp;version=NIV">metaphor for the Kingdom of God.</a> Yeast is such a tiny thing: even when using a starter instead of the modern dry yeast, just a little bit gets mixed with the flour and water and salt and oil. But that little bit transforms the ordinary into something extraordinary, something sacred.</p>

<p>And so I bake bread when I need to remember that the kingdom of heaven is mixed through my life, when I cannot see growth and change. Some breads rise high, escaping their proofing bowls; others puff slowly and almost imperceptibly. But either way, the yeast is working its miracle to change ordinary ingredients into the bread that will sustain others.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>(Spoilers throughout)</em></p>

<p>I feel a little awkward being in my mid-30s and asking the question of what I want to be when I grow up. After all, I was the college student with a definite plan, and I followed that plan all the way through to the tenure-track academic job. My identity was quite firmly rooted in being a college professor, and now that&rsquo;s not what I am. It&rsquo;s disorienting to deal with that loss while also trying to figure out what I want to be next.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m hooked these days by narratives about people facing identity crises, especially at the point in our mid-30s when we&rsquo;re supposed to be on the path to figuring life out. Enter Amazon&rsquo;s new show, <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</em> The show has won well-deserved popular and critical acclaim, winning among other awards Golden Globes for best comedy and best actress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the eight episodes of the show&rsquo;s first season twice now, once while my husband was out of town for a week, and then again with him. I don&rsquo;t watch many shows twice, and almost never twice in the space of two months, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this one as much the second time as the first.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s captured me most about the show is that every major character is struggling with same question I am: what am I going to be when I grow up? Who am I when life takes takes an unexpected turn and yanks away a part of my identity?</p>

<p>The series opens on Midge — the main character, Mrs. Maisel — in the midst of her ideal 1950s New York life: she has fashionable clothes, an account at the local butcher, the rabbi coming for dinner, a huge apartment beneath her parents' apartment, two children (a boy <em>and</em> a girl), and a husband. But over the course of the first episode, this life is shattered: she learns that her husband is having an affair, and he leaves her. It also later comes out that her financial situation is much more precarious than she knew, so she moves back in with her parents.</p>

<p>Midge had gained everything she wanted in life: a college degree, an upwardly mobile husband, a comfortable life, respect in her community. She was blindsided by her husband&rsquo;s betrayal, and the rest of the first season traces her attempts to relocate herself in the midst of so much upheaval. She finds a hidden talent for stand-up comedy, but her path is hardly clear and easy. She finds support and encouragement in the character Susie, who becomes her manager — more on her later — but Midge nevertheless makes multiple missteps and gives horrendous performances as she moves into a new career.</p>

<p>And Midge has to renegotiate more than just her identity: she must navigate a new relationship with her parents, as an adult child once again living at home. She has to renegotiate her place in her community as her marriage dissolves. She has to navigate employment and babysitters and the court system on her own, and while the show is a comedy the difficulty of Midge&rsquo;s position is clear.</p>

<p>Losing her identity as &ldquo;wife&rdquo; throws Midge into chaos. But the show is ultimately hopeful: losing this one part of her identity hurts, but it also creates space for other parts of her identity to emerge and flourish.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just Midge reevaluating her identity. Her husband, Joel, leaves in part because he feels stifled by the perfect 1950s life — but as Midge brutally observes, he has left her to live the Methodist version of his old life, not to live a new type of life. Joel then goes on to reevaluate his actions, confronting the fact that he threw away a good life in favor of a pale imitation because his discontent went far deeper than the externals of beautiful wife, two children, and luxurious uptown apartment.</p>

<p>Likewise, Susie — who works at the club where Midge first tries stand-up — sees Midge as her golden opportunity to not just watch performers but to shape one by becoming Midge&rsquo;s manager. Susie is grasping after a golden opportunity, and one that she has thought about before, so her identity crisis is much less acute than Midge&rsquo;s. But the two women must both work through what their new positions and relationship mean, and like Midge, Susie doesn&rsquo;t transition smoothly.</p>

<p>Even Midge&rsquo;s parents must grapple with change: while her father is offered his dream job at Bell Labs, Midge&rsquo;s mother has difficulty coping with the fact that her daughter may not have the life that both women envisioned. She cannot accept that Joel and Midge&rsquo;s separation may be permanent because a divorced daughter does not fit into the life she has always assumed she would have. (Midge&rsquo;s parents don&rsquo;t yet know of her ventures into the world of comedy; I imagine this will be a major plot point of the next season.)</p>

<p><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em> is about how the disintegration of Midge&rsquo;s marriage spirals out around her, forcing her to reevaluate her life and her identity but also bringing change into many other lives. Midge displays resilience and determination, but she and those around her experience grief and bewilderment and frustration through this process.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this show reflects the unexpected turns that life can take, and the pain that ensues when a cherished part of our identities collapses. It also normalizes this process: Midge has a crisis, but she will survive. And if a 1950s housewife can reshape herself as a stand-up comic, perhaps we too can survive our own crises of identity.</p>]]></description>

<p>If progressive Christians have a favorite bible verse, it is most likely <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+6:8&amp;version=NIV">Micah 6:8</a>: &ldquo;He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo; But what does it mean to act justly and also love mercy?</p>

<p>Justice and mercy are often seen as opposites, not companions. Yet repeatedly in scripture we see them coming together, as in one of my favorite images of justice and mercy. This one is found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+85&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 85:10</a> (or <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+84:11&amp;version=DRA">84:11</a> in the Vulgate, from which I&rsquo;m quoting): &ldquo;Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle ages, these four virtues were personified as the daughters of God, and the meeting and reconciliation between Mercy and Justice was often dramatized as a prelude to the Incarnation. (The image above, from the early fifteenth century, depicts the conflict between Mercy and Truth before the throne of God.)</p>

<p>While the details vary, the main point of contention between Mercy and Truth is whether humanity can be redeemed from their sins (mercy) or must suffer the penalty for their sins (truth). The two are reconciled in Christ, whose death satisfies justice while also providing mercy. Thus mercy and justice, peace and truth, meet through the person of Christ — and without him, they would remain at odds.</p>

<p>This medieval image of the daughters of God was meant to explain salvation through allegory. But it&rsquo;s also instructive as we think about acting justly and loving mercy ourselves: we almost inevitably value one above the other, and bringing them together often seems beyond our human capability.</p>

<hr />

<p>To show how difficult acting justly and mercifully can be, two brief case studies:</p>

<p>First, I came across a story in December about a 19-year-old undocumented immigrant, who while working as a housekeeper <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/12/15/a-maid-stole-some-rings-then-returned-them-a-jury-convicted-her-then-paid-her-fine-was-that-right/?utm_term=.03e1d15d1f0a">stole three rings</a> from a home she was cleaning. Although she didn&rsquo;t confess at first, she later did admit to the theft and return the rings. However, under Virginia law, she was still tried and convicted of felony theft. The jury imposed a fine of only $60 — the equivalent of a day&rsquo;s wages for this young woman — and then took up a collection to pay the fine for her.</p>

<p>The woman whose rings were stolen was aghast at the mercy shown to this young woman, arguing that justice was hardly served. The members of the jury felt that the felony conviction was more than enough justice; they wanted to show mercy in determining a low fine, and then paying it themselves.</p>

<p>Was justice served, if the housekeeper faced few consequences for her crime? Was mercy served, if the housekeeper now has a felony on her record because of a youthful mistake?</p>

<p>Case study #2: Andy Savage, megachurch pastor, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/us/tennessee-pastor-sexual-incident-teen-apology-applause/index.html">sexually assaulted a teenage girl</a> twenty years ago when he was leading a youth ministry (he has referred to this as a &ldquo;sexual incident&rdquo;). The woman, Jules Woodson, publicly <a href="http://watchkeep.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/silent-no-more-survivor-of-sexual.html">recounted her story</a> as part of the broader #MeToo movement after privately confronting Savage without receiving a response.</p>

<p>On January 7, during the Sunday morning service at his church, Savage confessed to the &ldquo;incident,&rdquo; claiming to be truly sorry and to be committed to working towards healing. The congregation responded with a standing ovation. (For a thoughtful analysis of this applause and why it is problematic, read <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2018/january/andy-savages-standing-ovation-was-heard-round-world-because.html">Ed Stetzer&rsquo;s <em>Christianity Today</em> article.</a>)</p>

<p>Savage is facing some consequences, despite his congregation&rsquo;s support; he is taking a leave of absence while Woodson&rsquo;s allegations are independently investigated, and Bethany House has cancelled publication of his book on marriage.</p>

<p>Is justice served by an investigation? Is mercy served by a standing ovation?</p>

<hr />

<p>In Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Portia argues eloquently for mercy for her friend Antonio in the famous speech beginning, &ldquo;The quality of mercy is not strained; / It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath.&rdquo; Yet only minutes after this passionate plea for mercy, Portia relentlessly tears down the entirety of Shylock&rsquo;s life, from his riches to his religion, reducing him to begging for his life. She has no mercy for the Jewish moneylender.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knows, as he so often does, that we like mercy when it applies to us and ours — but not so much when those unlike us (culturally, socio-economically, religiously) ask for it. Justice is much more appealing in those circumstances.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the sort of post with a neat answer. We can see that mercy and justice meet in the person of Christ, and we can agree that as we become more Christ-like we should seek to both do justice and love mercy. But that is far harder than simply quoting Micah, and in fact it may be impossible for our still-fallen human nature.</p>

<p>We can start by checking our own impulses: to whom do we want to show mercy, and who do we think deserves justice? And what do justice and mercy look like in particular situations? If we are committed to these two often competing virtues, we must be committed to the difficult, complicated, messy work that they entail.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Failure and Perfection</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>Last weekend, we went ice skating as a family for the first time. My daughters and husband had a great time, while I literally fell flat on my face. And my derriere. I made my way slowly and painfully around the rink only one time before throwing in the towel. It was, to say the least, embarrassing.</p>

<p>That was not how I envisioned the morning. I imagined us skating as a family, laughing as we glided around the ice together. I imagined helping my daughters up from falls and encouraging them to try again. Instead, they were the ones offering help and encouraging me: &ldquo;You can do it, mom! Good job!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m prone to idealistic thinking, and it&rsquo;s good to imagine how things can be at their very best. When I was teaching, I constantly reworked my syllabi to better achieve my goals — I even worked on redesigning an entire major. I&rsquo;ve grown to love the process of revising my writing, reworking sentences to be tighter, clearer, more forceful or graceful. I tweak recipes that I make frequently, adjusting proportions until the end result matches my aspirations.</p>

<p>My desire to get things right has made me a good teacher and researcher. It keeps my desk clear and my meals planned, my deadlines met and my children delivered to school on time.</p>

<p>But this idealism has another name: perfectionism.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the darker side of my idealism. Perfectionism means that the ideal — the often impossible ideal — is my goal. Perfect doesn&rsquo;t mean that my kids eat reasonably healthy meals most days; it means that I cheerfully cook balanced dinners every night and never serve mac and cheese from a box or order a pizza.</p>

<p>Perfect doesn&rsquo;t leave room for failures, and in my perfectionism any deviation from the ideal is a failure.</p>

<p>I know, of course, that living with this perfectionism is unsustainable. But as my fellow perfectionists understand, it can be hard to reconcile that knowledge with the strong feeling that if we just try hard enough we can, indeed, attain the ideal. After all, doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1:13-16&amp;version=NIV">the bible tell us</a> to be holy as God is holy? And if we should aim for this high ideal, why not all the high ideals?</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m learning, slowly, sometimes painfully, always imperfectly, how to live in the tension between the ideal good and the imperfect real. I can&rsquo;t abandon my ideals; hope, after all, depends on believing that things can be better, believing I can be better. But I also have to accept that I can&rsquo;t be perfect. I can&rsquo;t be as holy as God, even if I am supposed to aim for that goal. I can&rsquo;t live a life without failure. I can&rsquo;t even excel at everything: I have to balance my sanity against a vision of my children happily eating vegetables every night.</p>

<p>So last weekend, I had to accept that my ideal vision of joyful family skating simply didn&rsquo;t match reality. And you know what? It was okay. I applauded my daughters as they went around the rink, gaining confidence in a new activity even as they fell. I even applauded myself for making it once around rink and not quitting after the first fall. And I want to try again, with a better pair of skates but also with the expectation that we will have fun in the midst of falls and failures.</p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s the ideal after all.</p>]]></description>

<p>Had Martin Luther King Jr. not been assassinated in 1968, he would have been 88 years old today.</p>

<p>That fact catches me by surprise; he was younger, by a few years, than my grandparents. Growing up white in vast-majority-white small towns in the west and midwest, my knowledge of the civil rights era came from a few pages in my history textbook. Racism was an individual problem, but certainly not one we had. We didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;see race.&rdquo; We also didn&rsquo;t happen to interact with many non-white people, and I didn&rsquo;t have friends from other races as a child. The Civil Rights movement seemed to be a historical relic of a less-enlightened time.</p>

<p>I was in college before I began to have an inkling that the Civil Rights movement, despite making some progress, hardly erased the effects of centuries of slavery and decades of legally-enshrined unequal treatment of people of color. And it took even longer to understand racism as not just an individual issue but a systemic one, and to further understand that racism often emerges in more subtle ways than wearing white hoods and burning crosses.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write much about racism because I feel ill-equipped to say anything useful. I&rsquo;m a white middle-class woman who grew up in small western and midwestern towns with little racial diversity and who entered a profession — academia — that for all its progressive stances is not particularly good at welcoming and supporting scholars of color.</p>

<p>And so I stay mostly silent on racism. I don&rsquo;t want to come across as ignorant; as an academic in a humanities field I&rsquo;m painfully aware that I don&rsquo;t have a solid grounding in critical race theory. I also don&rsquo;t want to come across as a white savior; without the lived experience of a person of color, I don&rsquo;t have any authority on the best solutions to the variety of challenges they face.</p>

<p>But I also don&rsquo;t want my silence to come across as cowardice or complicity in racist structures and attitudes.</p>

<p>The Trump presidency has made it painfully clear that many people in America are deeply racist, and willing to be open about their racism. And even more Americans, including over 80% of evangelical Christians, either supported or were willing to overlook Trump&rsquo;s blatant racism and vote for him to lead our nation.</p>

<p>I want to stand against this racism, teach my children that as Christians we must honor other human beings and, as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:1-5&amp;version=NIV">Paul encouraged the Corinthians</a>, value others above ourselves.</p>

<p>I also want to work to make the church a better reflection of the coming kingdom, in which every people group will join together to worship God. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q881g1L_d8">In 1960</a>, Martin Luther King Jr. called Sunday morning &ldquo;the most segregated hour in America.&rdquo; 58 years later, numbers have improved slightly, but according to LifeWay research <a href="http://lifewayresearch.com/2015/01/15/sunday-morning-in-america-still-segregated-and-thats-ok-with-worshipers/">well over 80% of congregations</a> are still made up of primarily one race. The <a href="http://www.thearda.com/ConQS/qs_298.asp">2012 National Congregations Study</a> found that in more than 70% of white evangelical, conservative or fundamentalist churches, African-Americans make up less than 5% of the congregation.</p>

<p>Racism, even racism specifically in the church, is a large problem, and one that will take the concerted efforts of many people to address. So this year, as I work through my non-fiction reading list, I&rsquo;m educating myself about racism and the lived experiences of people of color. I&rsquo;m listening to their narratives, their analysis, their lived experience so that I can remember that my experience is not normative.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading <em>The History of White People</em> by Nell Irvin Painter, and I&rsquo;m moving Christena Cleveland&rsquo;s <em>Disunity in Christ</em> and Drew G. I. Hart&rsquo;s <em>Trouble I&rsquo;ve Seen: Changing the Way the Church Views Racism</em> to the top of my to-be-read pile. I read essays by Ta-Nehesi Coates and Roxane Gay (and Marvel&rsquo;s <em>Black Panther</em> comics, with issues written by both).</p>

<p>When I have time, I listen to podcasts: NPR&rsquo;s <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch">podcast</a> is an excellent starting point for understanding issues of race in America (as is the <em>Code Switch</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/">blog</a>). I&rsquo;ve also started listening to <a href="http://www.podasterystudios.com/truths-table/"><em>Truth&rsquo;s Table</em></a>, hosted by three black women who discuss race and faith in ways that are incredibly enlightening and challenging.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also trying to follow more people of color on Twitter, and as a starting point I recommend Gene Demby (@GeeDee215), one of the hosts of the <em>Code Switch</em>. Christena Cleveland (@CSCleve) and Austin Channing Brown (@austinchanning) are also great resources.</p>

<p>Listening to voices outside of my own experience and tradition as a white person won&rsquo;t solve all social ills, but it is a necessary step. In 2018, will you join with me in working to combat racism and build a church that honors the <em>imago dei</em> in all people? We are all starting from different points, but we must have this (often painful and uncomfortable) discussion in the church if we are to reflect the peace and unity of our resurrection life.</p>

<p>So, I have this theory about the White Witch in C.S. Lewis' <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.</em></p>

<p>She&rsquo;s inspired by Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>I can hear your shocked gasps over the internet. Oliver Cromwell? The seventeenth-century English general who led the Parliamentary forces that defeated the royal army? The Oliver Cromwell who was one of the signers of Charles I&rsquo;s death warrant? The Oliver Cromwell who ruled England as Lord Protector (more or less a military dictator) from 1653-58? The Oliver Cromwell who played a major role in one of the most audacious political experiments in Europe?</p>

<p>Yep, that Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p><figure class="float-left">

<p>Hear me out. What&rsquo;s the White Witch known for? Ruling Narnia with an icy fist, locking the country in a 100-year winter and never allowing Father Christmas to enter. Always winter and never Christmas, which is about the bleakest existence I can imagine (and imagine it I do, every February when Christmas is a distant memory and spring a distant dream).</p>

<p>(If I may be permitted a digression: I never once though of this until I started writing this blog post, but how in the world is anyone still alive in Narnia after 100 years of winter? How is anyone finding food to eat? The plants must all be dead, and I can&rsquo;t imagine the animals survived for more than a year or two without food.</p>

<p>Some dwarves are on the White Witch&rsquo;s side, and although Lewis never explains Narnia&rsquo;s economics, it&rsquo;s reasonable to suppose that they have an arrangement in which the Witch and the dwarves can profit from whatever they export from their mines. Thus the dwarves and White Witch may have money to  import food, and the Witch can feed her police and her informants, but pretty soon there wouldn&rsquo;t be anyone left to police or inform upon.</p>

<p>Plus which, if I were a Narnian, I think after about two years of dictatorship, never-ending winter, scurvy, and no Christmas, I&rsquo;d be like: screw this, we&rsquo;re moving to Calormen.</p>

<p>Of course, 100 years could be enough time for some evolutionary adaptation, so maybe just enough grows to sustain a tiny population — like the Beavers, and the fish Mr. Beaver catches for the young human children.</p>

<p>Am I overthinking this? Yes, yes I am. But now you can overthink it, too!)</p>

<p>Anyway. Back to my theory: the White Witch as Oliver Cromwell. Despite the recent decision to re-order new editions of the series, <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> was the first Narnia book written, and all we know about the White Witch in that book beyond her sorcerous powers is that she deposed the true monarch of Narnia, took power herself, locked Narnia in endless winter, and prevented the celebration of Christmas.</p>

<p>Now, the historical Cromwell was certainly not a sorcerer, and he did not change the English weather patterns. But he was one of the key players in the political upheaval that led to the trial and execution of the English king (Charles I) and the establishment of a Republic. This political experiment was short-lived; after four years of struggle by Parliament to establish a coherent government, Cromwell himself took power and ruled England as Lord Protector, and at his death was succeeded by his son.</p>

<p>The shocking and revolutionary political experiment then collapsed, and the English monarchy was restored in 1660 when Parliament invited Charles II, the son of the executed Charles I, to return to England as king.</p>

<p>History has, as one might imagine, viewed Cromwell in a variety of ways; for me today, at a distance of 350 years and living in a democratic republic, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to sympathize with Cromwell and the other English republicans who had grown distrustful of monarchy as a system of government.</p>

<p>But for a royalist, Cromwell is nothing short of a traitor, willing to kill a king anointed by God in order to seize power himself. Lewis seems to fall into this category: his White Witch, or King Miraz in <em>Prince Caspian,</em> show the dangers of monarchial power — yet the remedy is not a different form of government, but the restoration of the <em>true</em> monarch.</p>

<p>So far, so good: the White Witch and Cromwell both depose rightful monarchs, bringing chaos into their realms; Lewis has reason to pattern his king-killing despot after a figure in his own cultural history. But of course, Cromwell is far from the only person to ever depose a ruler, so this is not conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>What seals the comparison? Forbidding Christmas.</p>

<p>Now, Narnia is magical; there, Father Christmas is real, although prevented from entering by the White Witch&rsquo;s magic. Cromwell had no magic, and no real Father Christmas to keep out of England. But he, along with many other Puritan leaders, were appalled at the feasting, games and high spirits of the season; additionally, the Puritans were deeply of suspicious of holidays they viewed as &ldquo;popish,&rdquo; or originating in Catholicism rather than scripture.</p>

<p>So in 1645, Parliament banned the celebration of Christmas: there were to be no carols, no plays (like Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Twelfth Night,</em> meant to cap the twelve days of revelry from December 25 to January 6), no decorations, no time off for members of Parliament. According to the Puritans, Christmas celebrations were neither moral nor religiously significant, and thus the laws prohibited the citizens of England from observing Christmas either socially or spiritually.</p>

<p>(For more on this ban on Christmas, including the Christmas riots of 1647, I recommend <a href="http://www.historyextra.com/feature/no-christmas-under-cromwell-puritan-assault-christmas-during-1640s-and-1650s">this short article</a>.)</p>

<p>To be fair to Cromwell, he did not personally order the ban on Christmas. But it&rsquo;s also quite clear that he supported and encouraged the ban; during his years as Lord Protector, he continued to enforce the prohibitions against celebrating Christmas. Only when Charles II was restored to the throne could English citizens once again legally celebrate Christmas.</p>

<p>So to recap, Oliver Cromwell deposed a rightful monarch, took power himself, and forbade the celebration of Christmas. And order was only restored to England when the rightful monarch returned to the throne. It&rsquo;s not much of a stretch to see Cromwell as an inspiration for the White Witch.</p>

<p>Now, I freely admit that my theory doesn&rsquo;t change how I read and enjoy <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.</em> But every time I see something about the so-called &ldquo;war on Christmas,&rdquo; I think about Cromwell and the White Witch. Christmas can be a point of contention, a flashpoint for questions about morality and religion — even if today we question the morality of consumerism and the place of Christmas in a pluralistic society.</p>

<p>Let us not be Cromwells or Jadises, squelching the joy of the holiday for others. Let us instead be Father Christmases, celebrating with ringing sleigh bells and generous gifts and feasting and hope as we point to the one who makes Christmas possible.</p>]]></description>

<p>I hate New Years resolutions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perfectionist by nature, so when I fail to keep a resolution — as I inevitably do — I feel like a failure and then I toss the resolution and then fail like a failure for tossing the resolution. It&rsquo;s not a particularly healthy cycle, so I&rsquo;ve given myself a pass on the resolutions for the last several years. Besides which, on the academic schedule I&rsquo;ve followed for my entire adult life, August always feels more like the start of a new year. August resolutions aren&rsquo;t really a thing, so I can&rsquo;t fail at those.</p>

<p>But this year, for the first time, my kids are going back to school and I&rsquo;m not. 2017 was a rough year, and I feel the need to regroup and think about what I want to accomplish as I move forward. I&rsquo;m not making resolutions. But I am making goals and giving myself a word for 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop picking up my phone when I wake up. I always intend to just check the weather, but then I check my calendar, and my to-do list, and my email, and once I&rsquo;ve done that I might as well check Facebook, and then Twitter … and then the lunches need to packed and the kids need breakfast and I&rsquo;m still in my pajamas and annoyed about whatever I&rsquo;ve seen on social media. Breakfast of champions, digital edition. I&rsquo;m not sure if I can stay off social media until noon, but I can at least wait until the kids are out the door.</p></li>
<li><p>Read more non-fiction. My non-fiction to-be-read pile is embarrassingly large (my fiction pile is also embarrassingly large, but at least it rotates), and given a choice I almost always pick up the fiction to read. My awesome theology book club is a help here, but in 2018 I want to put a dent in my pile of non-fiction books.</p></li>
<li><p>Start writing my book. I&rsquo;m still processing my life post-academia, but I want to start moving forward. And even though I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what that looks like, with the blog launched I&rsquo;m ready to start working on something bigger.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>My Word:</strong></p>

<p>Three goals, one word for the new year, and that word is SPACE.</p>

<p>A lot happened to me in 2017, and I&rsquo;m still processing much of it. I like results; I like decisions; I don&rsquo;t like uncertainty and waiting. But in 2018, I want to give myself space.</p>

<p>Space to grieve and to heal. Space to try new things, and to fail, and to try again. Space to breathe on bad days, space to be spontaneous and happy on good ones.</p>

<p>Space to fail at my goals, and start again.</p>

<p>Space for old friendships to move into new patterns and space for new friendships to grow.</p>

<p>Space for the Holy Spirit in my life, to listen and learn and grow in my faith.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be seduced by the expectation that a new year will be a better year and by the hope that I will end 2018 as the impossibly perfect version of myself. So I also want to give 2018 space to be hard and unpleasant and full of anger and sadness and failures. But I hope, through all that the year may hold, that I will grow and work and learn and love and hope.</p>

<p>And I pray the same for all of you.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! I&rsquo;m taking a bit of a break for the holidays and spending time comforting my poor southern daughters, who are struggling with the sub-zero temperatures of the current cold snap. Much snuggling under warm blankets has been necessary (ah, the burdens of parenthood … ).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to posting on a regular schedule next Monday, and coming up this month I&rsquo;ll be discussing Oliver Cromwell, the White Witch, Margery Kempe, and my hopes for 2018.</p>

<p>I also have a guest post today on the Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE International) blog, in which I address the argument that husbands are responsible for their wives' sanctification (spoiler: they aren&rsquo;t). Read that piece <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/blogs/why-husbands-cant-get-her-ready-jesus?platform=hootsuite">here</a>, and while you&rsquo;re there check out the other fantastic resources on CBE&rsquo;s website.</p>]]></description>

<p>I meant to put this up yesterday, but I was distracted by Santa&rsquo;s generosity with Dove chocolates, a Christmas nap with a snuggling child, and a family viewing of that holiday classic, <em>The Lego Batman Movie.</em></p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s still Christmas — if the second day, not the first. Instead of two calling birds, I give you a poem by the nineteenth-century British poet Christina Rossetti. Her poetry often reflects on the experience of being a woman, and this poem is no exception: she places Mary&rsquo;s simply, physical breastmilk and kiss on the same level as the worship of heavenly beings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bleak Midwinter,&rdquo; Christina Rossetti (via <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53216/in-the-bleak-midwinter">Poetry Foundation</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,</p>

<p>Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;</p>

<p>Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>

<p>Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;</p>

<p>Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.</p>

<p>In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed</p>

<p>The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,</p>

<p>Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;</p>

<p>Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,</p>

<p>The ox and ass and camel which adore.</p>

<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,</p>

<p>Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;</p>

<p>But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,</p>

<p>Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.</p>

<p>What can I give Him, poor as I am?</p>

<p>If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;</p>

<p>If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;</p>

<p>Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>May you have a joyous Christmas season, in the promise and hope of Advent and Incarnation.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>The 6th and final part of an Advent series on incarnation. Read the whole series: <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>, and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-18-2017-advent-incarnation-V">part 5</a>.</em></p>

<p>As I write this, I can feel the tickle in the back of my throat that tells me I&rsquo;m about to get an early gift from my four-year-old: her cold. On a larger scale, I am still both physically and emotionally exhausted from ending a career this year that I had though I&rsquo;d be in for the rest of my life and then moving cross-country. I started medication for anxiety a month ago, and I can finally feel the tension beginning to ease out of my shoulders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing about how the Incarnation, the first coming of Christ two millennia ago in Bethlehem, teaches us to value physical bodies. After all, if the creator of the universe chose to become a human being and live among human beings, how can we live as though our bodies don&rsquo;t matter, or are hindrances to be overcome?</p>

<p>And yet, having a body sucks.</p>

<p>Our bodies get sick, with colds and cancers and chronic illness. Our bodies get tired and injured. Our bodies age. Our bodies experience the effects of mental illness, of stress, of late nights and early mornings, of difficult relationships and circumstances. Our bodies die.</p>

<p>During Advent, we remember that Christ came as a helpless infant, taking on human flesh and dwelling among us. But we also hope for his return, when we too will be recreated in new bodies free from the effects of sin. For Advent brings with it the promise not just of the coming king but of resurrection, of new birth, of new creation.</p>

<p>Advent is, in part, a time of joy, hope and anticipation — and the ubiquity of Christmas in American culture can often make us feel as though we are somehow deficient if we can&rsquo;t get into the Christmas spirit. No one wants to be an Ebenezer Scrooge at the holidays. But often, the problem is not that our hearts are two sizes too small; the problem is that our hearts are broken and our bodies are weary.</p>

<p>The good news is that Advent, the Incarnation, isn&rsquo;t about Christmas cheer. Oh, celebration is good: Advent is about the joy of God&rsquo;s presence among us. But Advent is also about the longing of God&rsquo;s people for their savior. We long for what we don&rsquo;t yet have, we mourn for the brokenness in the world, we suffer from sin and death and decay.</p>

<p>Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to just be happy. Advent acknowledges our pain and loss and sadness, and says: look, here is hope: hope in the willingness of a teenage girl to become the mother of God, hope in her husband who accepted her despite her pregnancy, hope in the shepherds and wise men who came to bow before the ruler of the universe in the form of a child. Hope that God&rsquo;s kingdom is coming, has come, will one day fully arrive.</p>

<p>But hope only works when life is not as it should be, just as light only makes sense in the darkness. For my readers in the northern hemisphere, today is the shortest day of the year, and Advent is framed by these dark winter weeks. The world is cold and dead, and we remember that we still suffer in sin and darkness; our physical bodies bear the marks of sin and death. But on this, the shortest day of the year, we remember that spring will return. Winter may stay for months, but we know that spring is coming. Life is coming.</p>

<p>Unlike spring, which always arrives, some of us may never experience healing in our bodies in this life. The waiting is much more difficult when we can&rsquo;t count down the days until warmth and life returns. But Advent doesn&rsquo;t ask us to deny the painful realities of our present lives.</p>

<p>Advent simply asks us to remember that there is hope. Hope in a manger in Bethlehem, hope that Christ will come again, hope in God&rsquo;s ultimate victory over sin and death.</p>

<p>The Incarnation, all those years ago in the body of a teenage girl, tells us that God created us good, values our bodies, mourns with us over the pain these bodies bring. It is also a promise that one day, all will be made whole again, and the effects of sin and evil and death will be removed from our recreated bodies.</p>

<p>In the words of Julian of Norwich, Advent asks us to hope that all will be well, and all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.</p>

<p>(For anyone struggling to feel the holiday spirit in 2017, I highly recommend Rachel Held Evans' article <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/unsentimental-advent">&ldquo;Mary, the Magnificat, and an Unsentimental Advent&rdquo;</a>.)</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 5 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2</a>, <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3</a>, or <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-14-2017-advent-incarnation-IV">part 4</a>.</em></p>

<p>How do you feel about God today?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an awkward question for me to write. Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to <em>know</em> about God, not <em>feel</em> about him? Doesn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9">Jeremiah tell us</a> that the heart is deceitful above all things?</p>

<p>But living in a body means having emotions. Even if we try to deny, suppress or muscle through those emotions, they still exist, often manifesting in physical ways: hunched shoulders, clenched fists, butterflies, tears, laughter, relaxation. If we elevate mind over body, we also elevate mind over emotions — an elevation further exacerbated by the association of emotions with femininity and weakness.</p>

<p>But once again, the Incarnation forces us to think about the whole experience of having bodies: experience which includes emotions. The body incorporates both mind and emotion, and attempts to deny or diminish this ignore the created reality of our physical existence and experience.</p>

<p>Every person, of course, experiences emotions differently (and different cultures understand emotions <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-15-2017-men-and-emotion">in different ways</a>). But emotions are a sign of being human, of having the capacity to respond to our world with more than just logic; emotions are a part of the divine image within humanity. Additionally, emotions are not somehow feminine; despite the way modern American culture suppresses men&rsquo;s emotions, men are not less emotional beings that women (and emotion is not feminine weakness).</p>

<p>We see Jesus experience and express emotions during his time on earth: his grief over the death of Lazarus, his weary need to withdraw from the crowds, his anger at the merchants and money-changers in the temple, his gentle exasperation with his disciples for misunderstanding his teachings. And more, we see Jesus experience and address his emotions. He weeps when he grieves and he goes to pray alone when he needs to rest from the demands of the crowd, rather than ignore or suppress his feelings.</p>

<p>I confess that emotions can be difficult for me. I tend to be controlled and reserved; I don&rsquo;t like feeling out of control emotionally, and it often seems safer to tuck emotions away rather than actually acknowledge and deal with them. And more, emotions aren&rsquo;t always a suitable guide for our actions or even a proportionate response to whatever evoked them. In short, emotions are messy, unpredictable, and often illogical.</p>

<p>But emotions can be good, as well. The joy of a child watching the first snow of winter. The upwelling of gratitude for the kindness of a friend. The flutters of love for a significant other. The peace of an ocean sunrise. Even our anger and grief can connect us to others and spur us to action.</p>

<p>The heart may be deceitful; we&rsquo;ve all experienced misleading emotional reactions. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend that the heart is somehow more deceitful than the mind. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18-31">Paul reminds us</a> that the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of the world; human reason alone cannot get us all the way to God any more than human emotion can.</p>

<p>God gives us both reason and emotion, and both have their place. In fallen, sinful human bodies, neither can be wholly trusted — but neither can be wholly dismissed. Emotion can temper our reason, reminding us that real people are affected by the rational arguments that we make on any number of topics. And reason can temper emotion, helping to move us beyond our initial reactions.</p>

<p>When we insist on logic and dismiss emotions as deceptive, we buy into a valuation of body and emotion rooted in Greek philosophy, not God&rsquo;s created reality. This denigration of our emotional selves emerges especially from strains of theology that emphasize orthodoxy (that <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">right mental furniture</a>) over orthopraxy, and from theologies that prize authority over experience. Both tell us to suppress emotions in favor of reason, whether our own or that of an authority figure (or a combination of both). I should note that this is my own tradition; the holiness tradition often goes in the opposite direction, valuing emotion above reason, and both imbalances can be dangerous.</p>

<p>You may also notice, reading this post, that I&rsquo;m trying to use rational argument to show that we should value emotion. Most people, it seems, gravitate to one over the other; I gravitate towards reason (as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re shocked to learn). But despite our own tendencies, we shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss our emotional selves.</p>

<p>To do so denies our created reality and thus denies the reality of the Incarnation, which placed immeasurable value on our created bodies.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 4 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a>, <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a> and <a href=".http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-11-2017-advent-incarnation-III">part 3 here</a></em></p>

<p>Over the last three posts, I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the ramification of the Incarnation — for bodies, for systems of belief, for women. But Advent is about both the already and the not yet: the world in which we live and believe and work and grieve and laugh, and the fully redeemed world for which we hope. Advent asks us to remember that Christ came, as a baby in a stable, and that he will one day come again.</p>

<p>Advent asks us to hold together the past and future, to step for a moment out of the linear time of alarm clocks and shopping days that rules our daily lives. Advent reminds that we are waiting for the coming savior, like Anna and Simeon at the temple, like Elizabeth and Zechariah, like the prophets of old.</p>

<p>And Advent should remind us that when the savior comes, it may not look like we expect.</p>

<p>The Christmas story is so familiar to most of us as to be almost banal. The manger, the shepherds, the wise men — we know the drill. Plus, we&rsquo;re used to the sanitized version, the adorable kids in lamb costumes, the nativities carefully unwrapped from tissue paper. Even if we understand how radical it was for Christ, the creator of the universe, to be born to a humble family in the humblest of circumstances, it can be hard to fully grasp how different this was from how most first-century Jews would have imagined the birth of their savior.</p>

<p>But we should be humbled by this reminder: how might Christ&rsquo;s second coming look different from what we imagine? And I don&rsquo;t just mean different from the predictions of a Harold Camping or Hal Lindsey (or, dare I say, a Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins). If God first came in the humblest possible manner, and proceeded to live a life amongst the poor and oppressed and sinful people of a conquered territory, what does this suggest about his second coming?</p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed, we affirm that Christ will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead — and if we&rsquo;re honest, we either ignore that part (judgment is often unpleasant) or assume that it will apply to others: Christ will judge people who actually deserve it, a group that surely does not include us. I think it&rsquo;s plain old human nature to assume that Jesus will affirm our rightness, or at least extend us grace, while hoping (secretly or not) for him to condemn others.</p>

<p>But the New Testament is full of warnings about judgment: I mentioned the passage in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46">Matthew</a> last week, where Jesus sends away those who did not feed the hungry or clothe the naked because what they did not do &ldquo;to the least of these&rdquo; they did not do to Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7:21-23&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a> even more clearly states that not everyone who says &ldquo;lord, lord&rdquo; to Jesus will be saved. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+3&amp;version=NIV">1 John 3</a>, the apostle John warns us that if we do not love we are murderers — and that we must love with actions, not just words.</p>

<p>These are uncomfortable passages, especially for us <em>sola fide</em> protestants; they carry the impression that our actions, and not just our mental faith furniture, matter for our salvation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not here to tear down one of the pillars of the Reformation, although I will note that orthodox Christianity in all its forms affirms both truths that only God can save and that our actions here on earth matter. So when we think of Christ returning in glory and judgment, we have to consider our own actions and how they align with the kingdom that Jesus inaugurated with his first coming.</p>

<p>And what does that kingdom look like? What sort of world do we see Jesus pointing towards in his time on earth?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a kingdom of healing, both physical and spiritual. It&rsquo;s a kingdom of grace for sinners. It&rsquo;s a kingdom that has no place for the rich and prideful, for those who jockey for positions of power and authority, for those who place heavy religious burdens on the backs of others. It&rsquo;s a kingdom inherited by the meek, built by the peacemakers, inhabited by the poor in spirit. It&rsquo;s a kingdom where a worker can get a full day&rsquo;s wage for just a few hours of work, where a heartbreaking disappointment of a son is welcomed home with open arms, where each individual matters regardless of their station in life.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the kingdom that Christ inaugurated with his incarnation, death and resurrection, his return will likely also disrupt and upend the systems that seem so natural and right to us today. And so even as we hope and long for Christ&rsquo;s return, we must do so with humility and the sober awareness that we might just be the Romans and the Pharisees rather than the least of these.</p>

<p>This is a challenge for me, to be sure. Tidy categories of right and wrong make judgment much easier to contemplate. And believing the right thing is simpler than doing the right thing. I do believe that sin exists and that beliefs matter. But as I&rsquo;ve discussed in the last several posts, the Incarnation means that we cannot stop at belief; what we do with our bodies in the physical world also matters. As members of the already-and-not-yet kingdom, we will inevitably fail to fully live into the tangible peace and justice and love of that kingdom — but we are to try anyway.</p>

<p>So this Advent season, may we remember Jesus' first coming and look forward to his second. And may we remember that his first coming upended any conventional idea about what it would mean for God to dwell among us, as one of us. Let us not become complacent that our right beliefs will insulate us from judgment, and let us not grow weary in doing good.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 3 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-07-2017-advent-incarnation-II">part 2 here.</a></em></p>

<p>The season of Advent reminds us that God took on human flesh; it also reminds us that this process requires women willing to allow God to work through their bodies. Women play vital roles in the Christmas story: Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; Anna, awaiting the Messiah in the temple; the Old Testament women — Tamar, Rahab, Ruth — mentioned in Matthew&rsquo;s genealogy of Jesus. And always Mary, whose faith and courage made her the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to focus on the men around Jesus: the genealogies, the shepherds, the wise men, the apostles. But the physicality of the Incarnation demands that women be a part of the story, and indeed we see women present from the manger to the cross to the resurrection, with Jesus at every key moment of the gospel story.</p>

<p>Jesus may have become God incarnate as a human man, but from Mary onward we never see Jesus treat women as anything less than co-heirs of his kingdom, equally created in the image of God. This is especially important because western civilization from before Jesus' time all the way through to ours has devalued bodies and women, elevating men and reason instead.</p>

<p>Patriarchy has been prevalent for most of human history, it seems — one of the first sins out of Eden. But in Greek culture, patriarchy combined with Platonism led to the association of women with the body and men with the mind. This association has morphed over the last two and a half millennia, but it still underlies assumptions about women: women are hormonal and emotional; women are vain and overly concerned with their bodies; women are less capable of logic and reason.</p>

<p>But the Incarnation upends these ideas about women and bodies: both are crucial to God&rsquo;s plan for redeeming and restoring humanity.</p>

<p>This is good news indeed for women.</p>

<p>At least in modern-day western culture (my own experience), women are constantly either told that their bodies are a problem or reduced to simply their bodies. The checkout lane at the supermarket shows both: discipline your body through diet and exercise — so that you can wield the power of a perfectly shaped body.</p>

<p>And we can&rsquo;t feel superior as Christians, since churches are seldom much better: purity culture, along with the even wider-spread Billy Graham (or Mike Pence) rule, frame women&rsquo;s bodies as inherently sinful, so tempting that they must be covered up and kept away from men. Additionally, churches that forbid women from holding leadership positions often do so with the argument that women are more easily deceived and less capable of leadership — code for being less rational than men.</p>

<p>We should certainly question the association of women with the body, since men are no less embodied and women are no less rational. But devaluing women tends to accompany devaluing bodies, and the Incarnation directly challenges both by elevating women and bodies.</p>

<p>What does this mean for women today, that Jesus came into the world through the body of a faithful woman?</p>

<p>It means that the process of childbirth is important labor, and ought to be valued and respected rather than regarded as an inconvenience to employers and the non-pregnant.</p>

<p>It means that women are more than their physicality, and especially more than their sexuality: Mary&rsquo;s body was important, but equally important was her faith, her consent to bear the son of God.</p>

<p>It means that women are not dangerous temptresses incapable of not seducing men; instead, they are companions to Jesus and vital workers in his kingdom from the time of the patriarchs through the present day.</p>

<p>It means that women, like men, are fully created in the image of God with all the privileges and responsibilities of such a high position within creation.</p>

<p>The Incarnation is good news for all, since God loved his creation enough to become part of that creation. And for women, devalued, sexualized, reduced to their bodies, the Incarnation is very good news indeed.</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 2 of an Advent series on incarnation; read <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/12/12-4-2017-advent-incarnation-I">part 1 here</a></em></p>

<p>Several years ago, my husband and I were part of a small group that watched <em>The Truth Project</em>, a video series produced by Focus on the Family. I have plenty of varied critiques of the material, but one phrase — often repeated by the main presenter — has stuck with me: he asked what the world would look like if we &ldquo;really believed&rdquo; what we claim to believe.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the phrase is that earnest mental commitment to a set of beliefs will, inevitably, change the way we live. But notice the emphasis: we need to work harder to <strong>believe</strong> the right things, to &ldquo;really&rdquo; believe. The orthodoxy (right beliefs) must, in this view, precede the orthopraxy (right doing).</p>

<p>But what does that mean? And why so much emphasis on our mental state?</p>

<p>Protestant theology in particular has a history of emphasizing salvation by grace through faith, rather than through works (although orthodox Christianity in all forms affirms that only Christ can bring about salvation). Additionally, Protestant theology was deeply entwined with Renaissance humanism, the sweeping intellectual movement running alongside the Reformation.</p>

<p>This intellectual grounding, plus a desire to avoid works-based theologies, meshed with the ever-present Platonism of western culture that values the mind (the metaphysical) over the body (the physical). And this results in a strain of Christianity that emphasizes right thinking, right believing, over all else.</p>

<p>In this vision of Christianity, the most crucial thing is to have the right mental furniture arranged in the right mental order. No papers scattered on the coffee table, no comfy but ugly couches, no chairs sitting askew; our intellectual house must be in order.</p>

<p>I confess, I like tidy mental systems and neat intellectual arguments; I want my mental faith furniture to have good feng shui, if I may be permitted a mixed metaphor. Clearly, what we believe shapes how we live in significant ways.</p>

<p>And yet. Can Christianity really be primarily about mental furniture? About the strength of our intellectual beliefs?</p>

<p>I think that the Incarnation gives a resounding NO to that question. God&rsquo;s great love for us was not only spiritual or metaphysical: love took on human flesh, <em>suffering</em> human flesh, in the person of Jesus Christ. Love became incarnate, became tangible, carried by a poor teenage girl and born in the lowliest of places. If the greatest expression of God&rsquo;s love required a human body, how can we return and reflect that love apart from our bodies?</p>

<p>One of the most sobering passages in the bible is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:31-46</a>. Here, Jesus envisions final judgment, saying to the righteous:</p>

<blockquote><p>For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p></blockquote>

<p>James tells us that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14-26&amp;version=NIV">faith without works is dead</a>; Paul tells us that all the spiritual accomplishments in the world <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:1-3&amp;version=NIV">are nothing without love</a>. We can really believe all we want, but until that belief becomes love and takes on flesh, becoming embodied in the world, all that belief is meaningless. The intellectual furniture matters only inasmuch as it becomes embodied in food for the hungry, clothes for the needy, company for the sick and imprisoned.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being honest, I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> believe in God all the time. Some days, it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to look at the wrongs of the world and believe that a good God is somehow present. Some days, the hope of resurrection seems like a beautiful but impossible dream. Some days, my prayers hover in the corner of my ceiling and seem to vanish into nothingness.</p>

<p>But forcing myself into some sort of intellectual certainty doesn&rsquo;t help on those days. What helps? Drinking coffee with a friend. Cuddling with a blanket, a book, and a child. Taking a meal to new parents. Opening my home to giggling 8-year-olds and their math homework. Volunteering with an organization that helps the hurting. Jesus tells us to love God and love others: how can we do that if we don&rsquo;t embody love, incarnate love?</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s love became a man, became a body, became relationships and shared tears and physical touch, broken bread and blood spilled out like wine. Our theology must reflect this, must include the body as well as the mind.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Paul, if I have the most perfectly arranged mental furniture but I never turn those beliefs into action, I have nothing. If the greatest love of all must become flesh, how can I respond except by incarnating my love in physical actions?</p>]]></description>

<p><em>Part 1 of an Advent series on incarnation.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday began the season of Advent, the weeks of anticipation and longing leading up to the celebration of Christmas. In these days before Christmas we recall the longing for the Messiah, fulfilled with the birth of Christ, and remind ourselves that we are still longing for the fullness of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. Much like Lent, Advent reminds us that we need a savior — and that our savior has come, born in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Advent is about the longing, about the hope of a candle lit against the darkness. It&rsquo;s also about the fact that Christ has come, that he was born to a woman in a particular time and place, that God dwelt amongst humanity. Advent is about incarnation: both the Incarnation, God become human, and incarnation, the fact of our physical bodies and the longing for the restoration of God&rsquo;s very good creation.</p>

<p>When we sing about sweet baby Jesus, silent in the manger, or when we set up our sanitized nativities, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the breathtaking reality of incarnation. Not only did God become a human being, but God did so in the most messy, most human way possible: childbirth.</p>

<p>What a breathtaking affirmation of the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>

<p>In my experience, we modern western Christians are not particularly good at thinking about the material creation. We are heirs not just to Christianity but also to Plato — whose articulation of the separation between the illusory material world and real world of ideal forms undergirds centuries of philosophy. Plato&rsquo;s conception of a reality beyond the material world meshes in many ways with Christianity, but with the unfortunate side effect of elevating the spiritual above the physical.</p>

<p>Elevating the spiritual or metaphysical over the material or physical is especially easy because of the way that sin has marred the goodness of God&rsquo;s creation. We develop arthritis, catch colds, fight cancer, experience heart failure. We often view our bodies as limitations, as weights that hold the true us (whatever that may be) back from fulfilling our potential.</p>

<p>But when we denigrate our physical bodies, we forget that when God made humankind and thus completed creation, God said that it — creation, the material world — was <strong>very</strong> good. And while sin may mar that goodness, it cannot erase it: our bodies were created very good, and will one day be recreated and restored to that goodness.</p>

<p>When God chose to come to earth as Jesus, he chose to take on the flesh that he had created. He chose to inhabit a physical body, to experience the joys and indignities of the body. And more, he chose to be born, to experience the fullness of human life from helpless baby, to unsteady toddler, to hormonal teenager, to suffering adult.</p>

<p>God didn&rsquo;t cheat, creating a body for himself out of nothing, or creating a perfect body. And the doctrine of the Incarnation says that his physical body wasn&rsquo;t just some shell, some avatar; rather, Jesus was fully human just as he was fully divine. Jesus&rsquo;s willingness to take on flesh shows a respect for and a profound love for the material body.</p>

<p>The Incarnation suggests that God redeems humanity not by separating the spiritual from the physical but by healing and integrating both. And so over the next three weeks, I&rsquo;ll be exploring what this means: how should the Incarnation shape our thinking about the material world, and our bodies in particular? What does it mean that the center of our theology is a God who willingly became human flesh? How do we live in the tension between the very good creation and the very real physical effects of sin?</p>

<p>The first candle in the Advent wreath is the prophecy candle, or the candle of hope. As we live in the tension between the promise and fulfillment, may the incarnation give us hope that all creation — material and immaterial — will ultimately be redeemed and once again made very good.</p>]]></description>

<p>&ldquo;Experience, rather than any authority in this world, is good enough for me to tell you about the woe that is marriage&rdquo;: so proclaims Chaucer&rsquo;s vivacious Wife of Bath in the opening lines of her <em>Prologue</em> in the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>. She frames the conflict between experience and authority vividly as she contrasts her wide-ranging marital experience (five husbands) with the academic theological authorities on women and marriage. Although her concerns differ in some ways from ours today, the tension between her lived experience and the authoritative thinking on femininity remains familiar to women.</p>

<p>As the allegations of sexual assault and harassment keep rolling in, and more prominent men face the consequences (most recently, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2BvU35Q">Matt Lauer</a>), I am finding Chaucer&rsquo;s 600-year-old exploration of the dichotomy between authority and experience particularly relevant. His Wife of Bath, Alison, experiences — often painfully — the tension between the authorities about women and her own life as a woman. Alison is well aware of the received wisdom about women: women manipulate men and lie about cheating; they care only about their position and appearance; they cannot control their sexual appetites (this last characteristic has, since Chaucer&rsquo;s day, switched from women to men).</p>

<p>And the Wife of Bath doesn&rsquo;t deny this received wisdom, exactly. She brags about how she manipulated her first three husbands, all elderly and rich, in order to gain wealth — while lying about her extramarital affairs. She unabashedly seeks social prominence, gained through her husbands' wealth. And she openly pursues her own sexual satisfaction in her fifth marriage.</p>

<p>But while authority describes the Wife of Bath, it cannot comprehend her lived experience. She tells us that she was first married at age 12: a surprisingly young age for even Chaucer&rsquo;s fourteenth-century readers, and an age at which the young Alison was completely at the mercy of authority — parents, guardians, husband. Of course Alison does what she can to gain some degree of power and autonomy, using the only tools she&rsquo;s ever been given.</p>

<p>Authority also comes into more direct conflict with experience in Alison&rsquo;s fifth marriage, to Jankyn — her only named husband. She, wealthy now from the estates of her first three husbands, chooses the young Jankyn because she finds him sexually attractive. But unfortunately for her, Jankyn&rsquo;s hobby is reading the so-called antifeminist authorities: those church fathers who most venomously attack and condemn women as uniquely sinful, the cause of all evil in the world from Eve onward.</p>

<p>In a scene worthy of any sitcom, Jankyn sits by the fire reading these authorities to his wife. She, unable to bear any more, rips the pages from the book and tosses them into the fire; Jankyn knocks her down in a rage. But when he sees that he has hurt his wife, he is overcome with repentance and the two reconcile — burning his antifeminist book.</p>

<p>Although Chaucer plays this scene for comedic effect, he also highlights the interplay between authority and experience. Jankyn&rsquo;s affinity for a certain type of authority leads him to treat his wife badly, haranguing her with readings on her inadequacies as a woman and even physically abusing her. These authorities can&rsquo;t remain abstract: they are inevitably reflected in experience. And Alison&rsquo;s experience suggests that these antifeminist authorities are dangerous to women precisely because they do not attempt to understand how their arguments affect the actual lived experience of women.</p>

<p>So how does this 600-year-old story connect to this particular moment, in which men are facing a reckoning as women collectively voice the pain of years of harassment and abuse?</p>

<p>In our society — both broadly and within the church — received authority tells us that men want sex, while women do emotions. It tells us that boys will be boys — and if you want to play with the boys, you have to learn not to cry. It tells us that women manipulate men sexually and that women lie, so their stories about assault are always suspect.</p>

<p>Women have known, have <em>experienced</em>, the consequences of these beliefs for decades. All too often, however, these experiences, because they conflict with the authority of cultural beliefs, have been denied and suppressed. And it&rsquo;s not just men who do these: we women do it to ourselves when we downplay and justify our experiences. (NPR&rsquo;s Kat Chow has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/25/565729334/gaslighting-how-a-flicker-of-self-doubt-warps-our-response-to-sexual-harassment">a brilliant article</a> on this topic.) Sometimes, especially in the church, we do this in response to overt authority; other times, it&rsquo;s under the pressure of cultural authority.</p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re witnessing a moment of experience talking back to authority: when we let &ldquo;boys be boys&rdquo; (code for bad behavior), we let them harm women. When we paint women as emotional at best, manipulative at worst, we make it impossible for them to hold men accountable for their actions. When we accept harassment as the price for workplace success, we condemn women to an extra burden of stress and discomfort in their jobs.</p>

<p>Ideas have consequences. Authority shapes experience. And authority that cannot acknowledge experience, cannot adapt when it produces harmful experience, is dangerous.</p>

<p>I love Chaucer because of the way he explodes binary oppositions — the Wife of Bath sets up authority and experience as opposites, but as we see in her tale they are inextricably linked. Chaucer demonstrates that problems arise when that link goes only one direction, from authority to experience; experience should also inform authority.</p>

<p>Changes to received wisdom are always slow. But as the experience of hundreds and thousands of women comes to painful light, I hope it will reshape our authorities on women. Women cannot thrive in a society that suppresses their experiences and refuses to let those experiences reshape our ideas.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/why-liberty-university-banned-an-anti-trump-christian-author-from-campus/544571/">News broke</a> at the beginning of November that Liberty University had Christian pastor and author Jonathan Martin escorted off the campus while he attended a concert at the invitation of the performers. Martin&rsquo;s offense? Officially, arranging to pray informally with students the next morning without obtaining the necessary permissions. Unofficially, criticizing Falwell for his support of Trump.</p>

<p>Although I find plenty of room for criticism in Liberty&rsquo;s actions, as a private university they are within their rights to exclude whomever they please. But their ban on Martin raises, yet again, the question of what the university is for: the free exchange of idea or the promotion of a particular point of view? Christian institutions like Liberty face the even more complicated question of how to engage with a wide range of ideas while remaining faithful to their core convictions.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at a Christian college, then graduate student and instructor at a large research university for ten years, then tenure-track faculty at a small Christian college for another four, I have wrestled with this question of what the university is for, and especially the Christian university. Over the past several years, the world of higher ed has struggled with the issue of how to engage with divisive ideas — a struggle that has broken into wider public consciousness periodically as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/us/middlebury-college-charles-murray-bell-curve-protest.html?_r=0">students protest</a> speakers they find objectionable.</p>

<p>Every society draws lines around acceptable and unacceptable ideas. At the most basic level, societies have taboos — those actions that are considered unthinkable and unforgivable, like incest. But often, what is acceptable shifts: a century ago, talking about &ldquo;inferior races&rdquo; was acceptable; today, most westerners find the idea deeply disturbing. Much of the problem facing universities today lies not in spoiled undergraduates but in shifting ideas about where we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable ideas, and who gets to decide where that line falls.</p>

<p>While the question of who gets to draw the lines gets much attention, I think we also need to ask how we can maintain a commitment to certain ideals in the face of opposing arguments. How can a university balance a commitment to valuing all humans equally with a commitment to understanding the ideas that have shaped history, even the ones that now seem abhorrent to us?</p>

<p>Back in the seventeenth century, the poet and thinker John Milton wrote an essay titled &ldquo;Areopagitica,&rdquo; in which he argues for the free exchange of ideas. Milton lived through the English Civil War, a war fought over conflicting ideas about religion and government. But despite the violence that he witnessed as ideas came into conflict, Milton argues for freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas. He is not naive about the potential dangers; he knows that ideas have power and that wrong ideas can be seductive. But Milton still argues passionately against censorship.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For Milton, people cannot be truly educated, cannot truly know what is good, if they are only exposed to a limited set of ideas chosen by a limited set of gatekeepers. And although Milton&rsquo;s argument was not accepted by the short-lived English Commonwealth, his notions of the free distribution of ideas undergird modern ideas about freedom of the press.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Every society, and thus every system of higher education, will have its orthodoxies and the desire to protect those orthodoxies. And the risk of the free circulation of ideas is that people may be seduced by the evil ideas, or the ones outside the accepted orthodoxy — some of which may be not so much evil as simply different.</p>

<p>In my experience, the university — Christian or secular — functions at its best when it strives to understand its orthodoxies while also giving students the freedom to explore contrary ideas. Having commitments to certain values is a good thing, but that does not mean that we should censor anything outside those values. This balance, however, can be difficult to find; it is thus not at all surprising that in a time of social change some find comfort in clinging to old orthodoxies while refusing to acknowledge contrary ideas.</p>

<p>The irony is hard to miss when a school named &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; errs on the side of rejecting those outside of its orthodoxy, rather than permitting the free exchange of ideas. But it&rsquo;s worth taking this moment to consider the responsibility of Christian higher education: when an educational institution stops allowing dissenting voices, is it still educating? And is the goal of a Christian university to educate or to defend?</p>

<p>I think that the value of education far outweighs the risk of dangerous ideas. But we have to be willing to take the risk in order to gain the reward, and this is the dilemma that faces the university.</p>

<p>The past year has been a challenging one for me. Eleven months ago, after much agonizing, I decided to leave my job teaching English at a small Christian college in Tennessee. And more, I decided not to keep looking for another academic job if I didn&rsquo;t get one during the 2016-17 job season. Five years on the academic job market had made my soul weary, and I even though I love my field I couldn&rsquo;t continue to put myself through that process.</p>

<p>So I quit my job, and when another job offer never materialized I moved with my family back to the Chicago area. It&rsquo;s been a disorienting season in many ways, although I&rsquo;m writing — this blog among other things — and slowly stretching into new ideas about my future.</p>

<p>But this is Thanksgiving, and in the midst of all the transitions of the last year I have much to be thankful for.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;m thankful to those of you reading this blog. Thanks for your support, and keep sharing posts you like with others who may appreciate them!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my former students, who challenged me to be a careful reader and clear communicator, and who indulged my nerdy enthusiasm for books and words.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful to my former colleagues for their warm and generous support, for wise advice, letters of recommendation, and sour cream donuts from Dunkin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for our friends in Tennessee, who loved us even as we left them and supported us in our move.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for old friends who welcomed us back to the Chicago area, and fed us and watched our kids while we unloaded and unpacked boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who have so generously welcomed us into our new church, making us feel at home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly thankful for my husband, who worked tirelessly to set up this website and who has been encouraging and supportive during this transition.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for my daughters, who remind me to laugh and play and drink hot cocoa on chilly afternoons.</p>

<p>I hope that all of you have good food and good company and many things to be thankful for this year. And for those of you who have struggled this year or who find Thanksgiving difficult, may you have a day of peace.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>]]></description>

            <title>God our Mother: Gendered Language for God</title>

<p>In one of those pieces of serendipity, a few weeks ago I heard the Liturgists' podcast titled <a href="http://www.theliturgists.com/podcast/2017/10/17/god-our-mother-live-from-boston">&ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo;</a>, featuring Christina Cleveland, and I read Katelyn Beaty&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2017/october/why-i-continue-to-call-god-father.html"><em>CT Women</em> post</a> on why she continues to use masculine pronouns for God. This question about the language we use for God is one I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last few years, especially as I&rsquo;ve come to see the value of gender-inclusive language in the bible.</p>

<p>For several years, I used the ESV translation of the bible. The more traditional language, especially in the Psalms, resonated with me — probably linked to the fact that the literary chair for the translation, Dr. Leland Ryken, was one of my first literature professors; he laid the foundation for my deep love of seventeenth-century British poets. But the steadfast refusal of the translators to use gender-inclusive language bothered me more and more as I read.</p>

<p>Most egregiously, as pointed out by Rebecca Card-Hyatt <a href="http://juniaproject.com/footnoted-bible-written-for-men-part-1/">on the <em>Junia Project</em> blog</a>, the translators chose to render the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em> in the New Testament as &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; a choice consistent with centuries of tradition. However, the translators footnote each instance with these words:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Or brothers and sisters. The plural Greek word adelphoi (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, adelphoi may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the translators reject the inclusive language that Paul himself uses in favor of traditional language.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read widely in English literature, and I do understand that often (although not always) the terms &ldquo;men,&rdquo; &ldquo;mankind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; are used to include women as well. However, language shifts; in modern-day English, it&rsquo;s no longer considered acceptable to use &ldquo;man&rdquo; as a stand-in for &ldquo;everyone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; as the equivalent of &ldquo;siblings.&rdquo; But the translators of the ESV simultaneously acknowledge and reject this fact by using &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; in the text but including the footnote that the word means both brothers and sisters. The translators choose exclusive, rather than inclusive, language on the basis of tradition without considering how this comes across to those excluded — namely, the women of the church.</p>

<p>So I switched translations, to the 2011 NIV. The Psalms aren&rsquo;t quite as melodious, but I don&rsquo;t feel intentionally excluded when I read the New Testament; that&rsquo;s a trade-off I&rsquo;m willing to make.</p>

<p>Thinking about gender-inclusive language in the case of a word like <em>adelphoi</em> has broadened into thinking about the language I use for God. I grew up using exclusively masculine language for God: God the Father, God the Son, God the warrior, God the bearded creator of Michelangelo&rsquo;s Sistine Chapel. And I do affirm that Jesus was made incarnate as a man, which makes the use of masculine imagery for God even easier to accept.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>Jesus may have been incarnated as a man, but God is a spirit, or a being who defies human categories, yes? If God doesn&rsquo;t have a beard, God also doesn&rsquo;t have male anatomy. And if God created both men and women in the image of God, God must incorporate both male and female; neither male nor female can claim to be the better representation of God.</p>

<p>Beyond the creation narrative, the bible uses both masculine and feminine imagery to communicate the nature and character of God.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> God comforts like a mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+66:12-13&amp;version=NIV">Is. 66:12-13</a>), longs to gather us as a hen gathers her chicks (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23:37&amp;version=NIV">Mt. 23:37</a>), and we relate to God as a weaned child to its mother (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+131:2&amp;version=NIV">Ps. 131:2</a>), among other images. And in the parables about the kingdom of heaven, Jesus gives us the image of a woman searching for a lost coin alongside the shepherd searching for a lost sheep, using both a man and a woman as analogues for the God who longs to recover us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15&amp;version=NIV">Luke 15</a>).</p>

<p>Additionally, God prohibited the ancient Hebrews from using images of God in worship; this sets them apart from the surrounding people groups who located power in physical idols, but it also has the interesting result of preventing the Hebrews from giving God physical shape, including a physical sex.</p>

<p>And yet, anyone who affirms a historical Jesus must acknowledge that he was incarnated as a man. Moreover, in the process of the incarnation God the Father is indeed the father. I don&rsquo;t want to push the biology of the incarnation too far, but given human reproductive systems God must be the father rather than the mother of Jesus. Building on Jesus as human man and God as his father, the church has historically used masculine pronouns for God and tended to conceive of God as male.</p>

<p>Envisioning God as male has had the unfortunate side effect, however, of making women seem less fully created in the image of God. A male God combined with ancient Greek medical science that saw women as mis-formed men has fed patriarchal social structures and negative views of women. In order to combat patriarchal structures that subtly demean women, we need to remember that God is not a man, is not constrained to human categories of gender or biological sex.</p>

<p>But how do we do that?</p>

<p>One answer is to use feminine pronouns and titles for God. In the Liturgists' podcast &ldquo;God our Mother,&rdquo; Michael Gungor rewrites well-known hymns to address God as a woman: this is our Mother&rsquo;s world. This phrasing feels jarring to me, but it also opens up new ways of thinking about God. Also, the discomfort I feel with saying &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; reminds me that I should feel similar discomfort with &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo;: neither can fully encompass who God is, while both can offer valuable (and biblical) insights into the nature of God.</p>

<p>In her <em>CT Women</em> article, however, Katelyn Beaty pushes back against using female language for God. She begins by arguing that for every person who struggles to accept the idea of God as a good father, there&rsquo;s someone who would struggle to accept God as a good mother. This point is true, of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense as a defense of calling God &ldquo;father;&rdquo; rather, it acknowledges the limitations of using any human metaphors to describe God.</p>

<p>Beaty also argues that calling God by neutral terms — creator, redeemer — risks de-personalizing God, making God an abstract rather than a relational being. This is an interesting point: I&rsquo;m not completely convinced that this necessitates the use use of masculine terms, but &ldquo;father&rdquo; is a much more personal relationship than &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; a term that may invoke a distant deistic god (or perhaps the dysfunction of a Dr. Frankenstein).</p>

<p>Although Beaty concludes that the church should continue to use masculine language for God, while encouraging men to fully reflect God by treating women as equals, I think her most important point is that God is a <em>relational</em> God. God wants to be known by us, but we humans can only understand God through metaphor and image; even the Incarnation gave us God mediated through human physicality.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;God our Mother&rdquo; podcast, Christina Cleveland rather tartly argues that of course people should be able to use masculine language for God; for some, this is the best way to understand who God is. And if God is relational, if God wants to be known by us, surely God understands when we use language that helps us to enter into a relationship with God — after all, no human language can ever adequately describe God. But if we accept this argument, then we must also allow people to approach God as the woman searching for a coin, not just as the good (male) shepherd; as the hovering mother hen, not just the strong warrior&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best approach is to embrace the variety of images and terms for God we find in the bible. Not every metaphor will resonate with every Christian, but that&rsquo;s not the point; if one metaphor could explain the nature of God and the Kingdom of heaven, Jesus would only have needed to tell one parable. Embracing variety will also remind us that God is above our human categories of gender and biological sex. We may pray &ldquo;God our Father&rdquo; in our liturgies, but we can also embrace the image of God as our Mother.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve challenged myself in this blog post to not use pronouns for God. This feels awkward; I&rsquo;ve typed and deleted &ldquo;his&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; more times than I care to count. But it&rsquo;s also liberating: if God is a man, I can&rsquo;t be created in his image. But if God is mother along with creator, redeemer, protector and father, I can better relate to and reflect that God. Just like reading &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; in Paul&rsquo;s letters, seeing the feminine attributes of God reminds me that I am fully created in the image of God and fully a part of the church and the coming kingdom of God.</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-18-2017-me-too">my #MeToo post</a> last month, I wasn&rsquo;t very optimistic that change in the way our society treats women was anywhere on the horizon. But it&rsquo;s been more than a month since accusations against Harvey Weinstein started piling up, and the allegations against powerful men just keep coming, as if the dam on a particularly noxious sewer has burst. In this past week, we saw Louis CK and Roy Moore faced with allegations of assault and just plain ickiness towards women — and both men are facing significant career consequences because of their actions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not Pollyanna; I don&rsquo;t think that somehow everything will be rosy for women from now on. I am, however, feeling some optimism that we have slowly, painfully and imperfectly cleared a hurdle as years of assaults and harassment come to light. Time will tell. But it does seem as if a critical mass of women&rsquo;s voices has been reached as men are being held accountable for their actions. The elephant in the room has made itself painfully obvious to even the most determinedly ignorant, and it refuses to return to invisibility.</p>

<p>I could vent my frustration that, starting with Harvey Weinstein, most of these men&rsquo;s improprieties and abuses have been open secrets. I could complain about the volume of accusations needed to reach this critical mass, as if one woman alone can&rsquo;t be believed. I could lament the time dedicated to protecting the reputations of powerful men rather than to nurturing the careers of ambitious women.</p>

<p>All of the above are valid frustrations that deserve to be acknowledged. But right now, this has the feel not of a moment but a movement.</p>

<p>So what should we do — and not do — to preserve the momentum?</p>

<p><strong>We should <em>not</em></strong> react with some variation of the &ldquo;Billy Graham Rule&rdquo; — the rule that tells a man to never be one-on-one with a woman other than his wife. The intentions behind this rule are certainly noble: the desire to protect the reputations of both men and women. But in reality, this rule too often entrenches a boy&rsquo;s club environment in which women are excluded from the casual settings — lunches, golf trips, after-work drinks — where networking and mentoring happen. This causes the divide between women and men to grow more entrenched and treats women as temptations waiting to become assault charges instead of actual people.</p>

<p>To be clear, I think some boundaries are appropriate: inviting someone to drink in your hotel room alone, for example, is not prudent in most situations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But a paranoid avoidance of women cannot be a solution. Most people can tell the difference between a man ambushing a woman while wearing his bathrobe and a man having a business lunch with a colleague. Men don&rsquo;t need to avoid <em>women</em>, they need to avoid <em>assaulting</em> women. (Katelyn Beaty, an editor for <em>Christianity Today</em>, had a <a href="https://nyti.ms/2hCw7sk">thought-provoking op ed</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> yesterday on this topic.)</p>

<p><strong>We should <em>not</em></strong> continue to question women who don&rsquo;t come forward immediately after the abuse takes place. Women remain silent for many reasons: the fear of repercussions from powerful men, the belief that they will not be believed, the shame that somehow they brought the abuse upon themselves. Especially when accusations come at an inconvenient time, as in the case of Roy Moore, the alleged victim is often treated with undue skepticism.</p>

<p>We need to be wary of the specter of false accusations, however: although hard numbers are difficult to pin down, false accusations of sexual assault are no more common than any other false accusations, and may be even less common. Over the last month, the sheer volume of women coming forward has made their accusations seem believable. But given the way that women are often shamed and treated with skepticism when they make allegations of assault or harassment, whether they come forward immediately or years after the fact, it&rsquo;s not surprising that women hesitate to make their abuse public. We should not dismiss women because they do not react to abuse in a way we deem appropriate, especially since what is considered an &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; reaction tends to vary wildly.</p>

<p><strong>We <em>should</em></strong> say something when we witness abuse or harassment. This one especially applies to men, who often have significantly more power and influence than women, but all of us can commit to calling out abuse, harassment, or demeaning language. Because much of the harassment women endure is low-level (a slightly too-touchy colleague, a friend who makes off-color jokes, a boss who relies on sexist stereotypes), we must become more willing to call out even minor harassment. Without consequences, formal or informal, this type of harasser has no reason to stop. We need to strongly and consistently notice and condemn harassment and sexist language, rather than simply shrug it off.</p>

<p>Someone here will object to policing language and behavior as mere &ldquo;political correctness.&rdquo; But these days, &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; often means &ldquo;acting with common decency,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s hard to see why decent people would want to be sexist. As a society we&rsquo;re currently renegotiating the boundaries of common decency especially around sexist and racist language, which does mean that some things are now offensive in ways they weren&rsquo;t twenty years ago. But it&rsquo;s not really that hard to avoid unwanted touching or sexist language, jokes and assumptions when we talk, especially since this is the necessary baseline of an environment that welcomes and supports women.</p>

<p><strong>We <em>should</em></strong> examine our own behavior and how we contribute to environments that silence women and enable abusers. Most of us don&rsquo;t actively enable abusers, but our collective cultural attitudes towards gender have caused harm. From a very young age, we condition girls to be emotionally sensitive and concerned for the well-being of those around them; we withhold emotional education from boys and excuse their bad behavior with a shrug and a &ldquo;boys will be boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as they grow older, we feed these young men and women with ideas about love as a pursuit, with man as the hunter of the woman, who will put up a fight even if she doesn&rsquo;t really mean it. With this conditioning, it&rsquo;s not surprising that some men believe they can get away with assault and some women believe that they have to put up with it. It can be difficult to escape these strong and often unconscious cultural assumptions, but we have to be willing to do the work to change the script for ourselves and for the generations that come after us.</p>

<p>Cultures change slowly and painfully, with steps backwards and sideways for every step forward. But let us make the last six weeks one of the steps forward, a moment that changes how we treat women. Let us acknowledge our own responsibility to foster a culture that does not enable abusers and harassers, and commit to nourishing a culture that treats women as human beings equal to men.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard a sermon on guns or gun violence.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been in God and guns sort of churches (or attended chapel at Liberty University), where I might have been more likely to hear something about guns. But pretty much everywhere in America, guns are a touchy issue due to both the Second Amendment and a culture that glorifies guns and gun violence. It&rsquo;s not surprising that few pastors want to venture into this particular minefield. And yet, as Christians, we need to learn to think theologically about guns.</p>

<p>The political issue of gun control is large and complex, and further complicated by the sheer number of guns in the United States — nearly 90 guns for every 100 people. I&rsquo;m not going to tackle the practical or political side of this issue today, although for those interested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html">Nicholas Kristof&rsquo;s Nov. 6 opinion piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> makes a number of reasonable suggestions. Instead, I want to challenge us as Christians to do a better job of thinking theologically about gun violence. Even when we disagree about gun policies, we Christians can and should have a thoughtful theological grounding as we approach this topic.</p>

<p>The cornerstone for any theology of violence is, obviously, the conviction that life matters, that all humans are created in the image of God and that God cares for each human life — and expects us as Christians to do likewise. But this belief is so broad as to be almost meaningless; it vanishes into arguments about just war or self defense, or claims that the perpetrators of gun violence are mentally ill and thus incapable of moral reasoning. We may all agree that life is valuable, but this belief hasn&rsquo;t forced Christians to confront our own complicity in a culture that glorifies guns and turns a blind eye to the consequences of that glorification.</p>

<p>So we need something beyond valuing life to undergird a theology of guns. I want to suggest three ways to approach this theology: first, understanding the transformation of weapons into life-giving tools in the coming kingdom of God; second, resisting the impulse to fear; and third, rejecting the glorification of guns and gun violence.</p>

<p>Two different prophets in the Old Testament — <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+2:4&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+4:3&amp;version=NIV">Micah</a> — use the image of swords being beaten into plowshares as they describe the coming kingdom of God, a time when God reigns on earth with justice and peace and when war no longer exists. This image of swords and plows not only removes the need for weapons but flips their purpose, transforming tools that bring death into tools that bring life. Further, when Jesus is betrayed and arrested, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26:47-56&amp;version=NIV">he tells Peter</a> that his kingdom will not be inaugurated by a violent conquest but instead by his own submission to violence.</p>

<p>Christians have certainly had many disagreements over centuries about what these passages, and others, mean for our lives. I think a strong case can be made for Christian pacifism, although arguments about just war that allow Christians to use violence in certain situations are, and historically have been, widely accepted in the church. But regardless of our own convictions the use of violence, we must understand that we are longing for a kingdom in which violence has no place, in which we nourish life rather than mete out death. Many Christians see violence as necessary in a fallen world, but we should always approach violence soberly, in the knowledge that it is a product of our sin.</p>

<p>What does this approach to violence mean for a theology of guns? Guns are like swords: their purpose is to kill. They exist to bring death, not life, even if many gun owners never use them outside a firing range. Christians are people of new life, not death, and this conviction should underly our attitude towards guns. On a practical level, Christians should be the most responsible gun owners and should be wary of the proliferation of guns. Guns won&rsquo;t ever be anything other than tools of death, but they can be made safer, harder to obtain, and rarer.</p>

<p>My second approach builds on the first: as Christians, we must reject the culture of fear that encourages gun ownership. One of the most common commands in scripture is &ldquo;fear not&rdquo;: not even death can harm us now that we are in Christ. But fear often spurs gun sales, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/gun-sales-mass-shooting/541809/">now-predictable spike in gun sales</a> that follows mass shootings. The fears vary — of another shooting, of tightened regulations — but the result is more guns and more fear. Christians can reasonably disagree about the use of violence, but we must be vigilant about being manipulated by manufactured fears.</p>

<p>Living in fear leads to distrust and isolation. With the gun issue, we distrust anyone on the opposite side, assuming that they want to leave us vulnerable to harm (which may mean too many or too few guns, depending on the point of view). Brené Brown wrote a wonderful <a href="http://brenebrown.com/blog/2017/11/08/gun-reform-speaking-truth-bullshit-practicing-civility-affecting-change/">article</a> on, among other things, the way we demonize the opposite side in this debate; I would add that our tendency to polarize on this issue arises from fear. In one of his epistles, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:18&amp;version=NIV">John writes that</a> &ldquo;the one who fears is not made perfect in love.&rdquo; Love leaves no room for fear, but the converse is also true: fear makes love difficult. A culture that encourages us to fear the other (whoever that may be) is incompatible with a culture that tells us to love one another.</p>

<p>For our theology of guns, this means that Christians must guard against fear as a motivation for owning guns. But more than this, we cannot allow fear to poison our relationships with other Christians with whom we disagree. Fear and distrust prevent constructive conversations about guns and gun violence, and Christians should be able to set an example for reasonable, productive dialogue.</p>

<p>Finally, my third approach for a theology of guns requires that we reject the glorification of guns and gun violence. As Americans, we are all complicit in the celebration of violence that permeates our culture, from films to music to sports (and even <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/jesus-throw-punches-fight-church-christian-ministries-fight/story?id=25953786">churches</a>). And while the problem of celebrating violence is larger than guns, Clint Eastwood and James Bond demonstrate that guns are often associated with strength and sexual attractiveness. The good guy with a gun is an almost mythic figure revered in American society.</p>

<p>But time and again in scripture, God rejects the glorification of violence and the idolization of the hero. In the Old Testament, God uses the small, the weak, and  the inexperienced to defeat the powerful: David and Goliath, Gideon&rsquo;s tiny army, Jael&rsquo;s defeat of Sisera. And in the New Testament, neither Jesus nor the apostles ever encourage violence as a way of life, as a method of bringing about God&rsquo;s kingdom. Jesus says that the meek and the peacemakers are blessed, not the warriors. Power, physical and otherwise, may be prized by the world, but the kingdom of God subverts these values and exalts the weak instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians should never enjoy a war film or a Bond movie, take a self defense course or serve in the military. But we need to turn a critical eye on violence in American culture and resist the tendency to admire violence. This means swimming upstream against the currents of most human history; modern-day America is hardly unique in its glorification of violence. When it comes to guns, we need to look hard at our motivations: do we intend to use them as tools, albeit deadly ones, or are they accessories to our own ideals of self-reliance, strength or sexiness? Because the latter does not track with the virtues Christians are supposed to cultivate.</p>

<p>The three approaches I&rsquo;ve outlines above are meant as a starting point, not a final word, for a theological framework for guns. All three points can be expanded and their implications on gun policy debated. But gun debates tend to devolve into arguments about safety on the one hand and the Second Amendment on the other. Neither is the right starting point for Christians, and frankly neither addresses the very real legal and social complexities of gun ownership in America. As Christians, we should have a third way, a theological way, of addressing this issue.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all Christians will agree on gun policies. But it should mean that we can approach this topic not out of fear or defensiveness, but in the spirit of peace and charity. In particular, we must remember that guns are tools of death that may be necessary evils now but that we trust will one day be unnecessary. This knowledge combined with a resistance to both fear-mongering and the glorification of gun violence will lay a foundation for real discussions of what gun ownership should look like in America.</p>

<p>Because we live in the hope of a coming kingdom of peace and justice, Christians have every reason to set the tone for this discussion. It&rsquo;s time we step up, regardless of our side on the issue, and do so.</p>

            <title>Women in Christian Theology: Queen Elizabeth I</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is part of a recurring series on women in theology. My goal in this series is not to highlight exceptional women but instead to discuss the many contributions of women that frequently go unremarked or overlooked.</em></p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/11-01-2017-500-years-reformation">Martin Luther</a> and the protestant Reformation, so it seems appropriate this week to consider a woman who was crucial to the Reformation in England. Elizabeth I may not be an obvious choice for a series on theology, but her personal convictions and political astuteness laid the foundation for today&rsquo;s global Anglican Communion.</p>

<p>To understand Elizabeth&rsquo;s role in the English Reformation, we need a short(ish) history lesson. Elizabeth&rsquo;s father was Henry VIII, most famous for his many wives and king of England in the early sixteenth century, as the Reformation was gathering steam in Germany, Switzerland and the the Netherlands. However, Henry was not interested in the ideas of the reformers; in fact, he wrote<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a treatise defending the seven sacraments in response to Martin Luther&rsquo;s attack on indulgences. For this work, and for his continued support of the papacy, pope Leo X named Henry Defender of the Faith in 1521.</p>

<p>And yet, in a plot twist still fit for modern television, Henry grew enamored with the young Anne Boleyn. His wife, Catherine of Aragon, was past the age of childbearing and had not managed to produce a male heir despite seven pregnancies.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> So Henry sought what many heirless nobles before him had acquired: an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.</p>

<p>Catherine, however, was a well-connected and strong-willed woman. Her parents were Ferdinand and Isabella of Christopher Columbus fame; her siblings unified Spain through strategic marriages; her nephew Charles V ruled the Holy Roman Empire. She was loath to give up her position as queen of England, and it seems that Charles V pressured the pope on her behalf to deny the annulment. While the politics and motivations of Henry, Catherine and the pope are complex, the result was not: Henry was not granted his annulment.</p>

<p>When Henry VIII tired of waiting the pope to dissolve his marriage to Catherine (and when Anne Boleyn gave birth to his daughter, Elizabeth), he began a two-year process that culminated in the Acts of Supremacy of 1534, in which parliament declared Henry the head of the church in England. Henry himself seems to have imagined this new church as theologically identical to the Catholic church, just without the pope. However, many of the architects of the Acts of Supremacy were reformers deeply influenced by Luther. Their influence with Henry was tenuous, but upon his death in 1547 many of these reformers — including Thomas Cranmer, architect of the <em>Book of Common Prayer</em> — became principle advisors to the young Edward VI.</p>

<p>Edward VI was the son of Henry&rsquo;s third wife, Jane Seymour (she succeeded Anne Boleyn, after Anne&rsquo;s execution); he thus grew up protestant and seems to have been genuinely enthusiastic about supporting the English reformers as they guided the nascent Anglican church in a more reformed direction. However, he was frequently ill and died in 1553 at the age of fifteen, at which time he was succeeded on the throne by his older sister, Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry&rsquo;s first wife, Catherine of Aragon.</p>

<p>This Mary, of course, is Bloody Mary: she violently and swiftly returned England to the Catholicism she had refused to give up. After Henry divorced Catherine, he forced the teenaged Mary to stay in London and would not let her see her mother, even when Catherine was dying. Yet Mary refused to give up her Catholic faith, even when pressured by first Henry and later Edward. Although Edward and his advisors worked frantically to prevent Mary from taking the throne, her legal standing in the line of succession and her popular support meant that she succeeded Edward.</p>

<p>After taking the English throne, Mary wedded Philip of Spain, the son of her cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Spain was emerging as the most powerful defender of Catholicism in Europe, so this alliance solidified Mary&rsquo;s intention to keep England firmly in the Catholic fold. Unfortunately for Mary and English Catholics, she died in 1558, leaving no heir but her half-sister Elizabeth — Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s daughter whose imminent birth (and the hope that she would be a son) had launched Henry on the path of defying Rome.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came to the throne of England in 1558 at the age of 25. England was in turmoil after the rapid shifts from Catholic to protestant to Catholic and back again, not to mention the turmoil always caused by short reigns and disputes over succession. In addition, as a woman Elizabeth faced significant challenges: the early modern period saw the reemergence of the ancient Greek notion that it was inappropriate for women to participate in the public sphere of politics.  Elizabeth thus had to contend with arguments like that published by John Knox in 1558, titled <em>The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</em>. Knox attacked Catholic women monarchs, especially Mary, but built a broader argument against the rule of women in general.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>In short, Elizabeth faced a political challenge: how could she assert her authority in acceptable ways, especially as the head of the Anglican church, and bring peace and unity to England?</p>

<p>By all accounts, Elizabeth succeeded brilliantly over the course of her long and prosperous reign. Her letters and speeches provide a master course in wielding power as an early modern woman. But for the Church of England specifically, Elizabeth&rsquo;s commitment to peace and wide latitude for differing beliefs laid a distinctive foundation for Anglicanism.</p>

<p>After the disruption caused by Mary&rsquo;s reign, Elizabeth envisioned an English church that could encompass all but the most dedicated Catholics and fervent reformers.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> This middle way, or <em>via media</em>, allowed for the continuation of some Catholic elements, like vestments, even as the services (following protestant theology) were conducted in English and the number of sacraments reduced from seven to two. Broadly, this middle way means that Anglican churches even today balance word and sacrament in their services: while Catholic masses tend to emphasize the eucharist (sacrament) and protestant services highlight the sermon (the word), most Anglican services seek to give equal emphasis to both.</p>

<p>In addition to the elements of worship services, Elizabeth&rsquo;s <em>via media</em> also allows for wide latitude in theological beliefs. The foundational theological text of Anglicanism is <em>The Thirty-Nine Articles,</em> which is clearly informed by protestant theology as it among other things permits priests to marry and rejects the idea of Purgatory. Yet <em>The Thirty-Nine Articles</em> allows for a range of beliefs about predestination, for example, and the nature of baptism and the eucharist.</p>

<p>Perhaps more important for the <em>via media</em> than either a mix of worship elements or a flexible theology is the <em>Book of Common Prayer.</em> Elizabeth&rsquo;s 1559 Act of Uniformity required all English churches to use the <em>Book of Common Prayer,</em> which meant that regardless of theological disagreements all English Christians worshipped together with the same prayers and rites. This unity in prayer powerfully bridges divisions in theology, even in today&rsquo;s Anglican Communion. Thus in both ritual and theology, Elizabeth envisioned and created an Anglican church that could unify England.</p>

<p>Without Elizabeth&rsquo;s commitment to peace and unity, and her able statesmanship, England could have collapsed into the religious warfare that rocked Europe in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Of course, England did become embroiled in a civil war with religious underpinnings forty years after Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, but that was due as much to the attempts of James I and Charles I to assert absolute sovereignty as to religious differences.</p>

<p>As a woman, Elizabeth could not attempt to assert absolute power; instead, she had to rule with careful political negotiations and a self-effacing humility. But these qualities endeared her to her people during her long reign and allowed her to heal the fractures of the short reigns and religious shifts that preceded her. She succeeded in uniting English Christians around a flexible protestant theology and, perhaps most importantly, a single prayer book that shaped how generations of Christians have prayed and lived.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was not the sole architect of the Anglican church, but without her wise and careful political guidance it surely would not have grown into one of the largest Christian denominations, with 85 million members worldwide. Because she was a woman and a politician, rather than a theologian, her contribution to the formation of the Anglican church is often left to historians. But she deserves to be honored for her wise governance that allowed the English church to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>This past week has been an exciting one in my house, as my middle daughter was baptized and we had the joy of celebrating with many family members.</p>

<p>However, houseguests and other obligations mean a break on the blog today and a schedule change for the rest of 2017. Instead of posting three times a week, I&rsquo;m scaling back to twice. New posts will go up on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>

<p>Thanks to all for reading!</p>]]></description>

<p>When I was a teenager in a dispensational evangelical church, I had a guilty secret: I didn&rsquo;t really want the Rapture to happen. Definitely not before I had been kissed by a boy, and preferably not before I&rsquo;d had sex. I always felt guilty about my lack of enthusiasm for the return of Christ. I did love Jesus; I just didn&rsquo;t see much appeal in his return, the destruction of the earth, and a blissful but marriage-less existence in heaven.</p>

<p>Both age and moving away from dispensationalism changed this for me. Simply having more life experience, more awareness of the sin and brokenness in the world, made me more aware of our need for Christ&rsquo;s return. And N.T. Wright&rsquo;s vision of the kingdom of God, a place in which justice and mercy abound and all wrongs are made right, gave me a more profound and attractive picture of what happens when Jesus brings about his kingdom.</p>

<p>In my new understanding of the kingdom, I also see God&rsquo;s kingdom as something I&rsquo;m working towards, not simply waiting for. Not in the sense that I have to earn it, but in the sense that my efforts towards peace, justice, reconciliation, mercy, and love — no matter how imperfect — bring a foretaste of God&rsquo;s kingdom and will, somehow, remain part of the kingdom when it arrives in fullness.</p>

<p>But at this point, I image that my readers are wondering if I&rsquo;ve put the wrong title on this blog post: what does this kingdom of Christ have to do with outrage culture and charity?</p>

<p>For those of us in the United States, we&rsquo;ve seen the rise of outrage culture over the last several years, exacerbated by last year&rsquo;s presidential election. The 24-hour news cycle and the immediacy of social media fuel outrage on both the left and the right about any number of events or ideas. The outrage is often manufactured, although the injustices and evils are often real. And for those of us who long for Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and who want to work towards the peace, justice and reconciliation of that kingdom, it can be hard not to get caught up in the outrage.</p>

<p>And outrage and anger aren&rsquo;t always wrong responses to injustice in the world. Anger can alert us that something is not right, that injustice or oppression or violence is occurring; anger is a natural response to the wrongness of evil in the world. But anger is also exhausting and unsustainable. This exhaustion is exacerbated by the cycle in which we&rsquo;re distracted from our anger by something new to be angry about. We end up jaded and cynical, caught in the outrage cycle without an exit.</p>

<p>And so we stew in anger that grows into bitterness, cynicism or a feeling of profound helplessness in the face of so much evil in the world. We end up numb to the injustices that once made us angry.</p>

<p>So the question arises: how can we keep a tender heart towards the injustices and evils in the world without burning out on anger and outrage? Because as Christians who long for the coming of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom and who believe that we are to work towards that kingdom, we can&rsquo;t ignore the evil in the world. We can&rsquo;t sit back and wait for it all to burn, or for Jesus to rescue us; we are to be Christ in the world, to feed the hungry and comfort the hurting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have easy steps to avoid outrage, but I have one suggestion: practice charity.</p>

<p>Not the donating used clothing sort of charity, but the charity of faith, hope and charity — the charity that is profound love. Outrage culture thrives when we have an &ldquo;Other&rdquo; to rage against — someone or some group that represents everything that is wrong with the world. Charity approaches that &ldquo;Other&rdquo; as a beloved child of God. Maybe a deeply misguided or even abusive child of God, but a child of God nonetheless. Remember that our struggle is not against people but against powers, and that we are to love our enemies just as we love our friends.</p>

<p>Responding to outrage with charity doesn&rsquo;t mean that we ignore injustices; charity doesn&rsquo;t ask us to pretend that evil doesn&rsquo;t matter. But charity gives the nameless other a face and an identity: child of God. This charity towards others will inevitably temper our outrage. It takes work to see those with whom we disagree as worthy of God&rsquo;s love and ours, but this work is necessary if we want to be free from the cycles of outrage. To be clear, we may still be angry, and rightfully so, because of different events or actions; we will still work against evil. But we can&rsquo;t sustain both outrage and charity, and it is clear which one Jesus calls us towards.</p>

<p>Above all, we must remember that even as we work in the already-but-not-yet kingdom of God, we rely on God, not ourselves, to ultimately redeem the world. We may have reason for anger, but we have no reason for hopelessness. Our labor will not be in vain, even when it seems we make little headway against the evils of the present age. Outrage is an easy but shallow response to the wrongs we see around us. Faith, hope and charity are harder — but better by far.</p>]]></description>

<p>500 years ago yesterday, according to tradition,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenburg, Germany, launching the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p>I always feel a little bit ambivalent about the Reformation. On the one hand, I am a protestant with no intention of crossing the Tiber; I have great respect for Catholic theology, but I align more closely with protestant theology. On the other hand, as an academic medievalist and professional cranky person about historical ignorance, I believe it&rsquo;s important to understand Luther in his context, not as the lone savior of Christianity. Luther&rsquo;s successful schism with the Catholic church was a product of broad cultural and political forces; understanding these forces helps us to better appreciate what Luther launched and to consider what it means to talk about the body of Christ five hundred years after the Reformation.</p>

<p>Growing up protestant (of the non-denominational evangelical variety), the common narrative about the Reformation was that True Christianity™️ had somehow disappeared for at least a millennium before it was revived by the reformers. When it disappeared was a bit vague — with Constantine? The fall of Rome? But its reappearance was easy to identify: Martin Luther and the 95 Theses nailed to the door of the Wittenburg church.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But like all narratives, this one simplifies history in order to focus on only one figure, who comes across as extraordinary. In reality, Luther was part of a much larger push towards reform, and his theology gained a significant boost from the political situation in the Holy Roman Empire (which at the time included much of modern-day Germany).</p>

<p>The idea that the church was essentially dead through the middle ages would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t common, and I address broad misconceptions about the middle ages, including the medieval church, <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">here</a> and <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-06-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">here.</a> But more specific to the Reformation, the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries — Luther&rsquo;s time period — saw an increase in lay spiritual practices and efforts to reform corruption and theological abuse in the Roman church. Corruption was indeed rampant in the church during this period, particularly in various popes' involvement with the politics of Italian city-states and the Holy Roman Empire. Popes like Julius II used warfare to expand their lands and accumulated vast amounts of wealth in less than ethical ways.</p>

<p>Although open warfare led by the pope was thankfully rare, the drive to increase the papacy&rsquo;s wealth lead to an increase in the sale of indulgences, which became a key point of contention for many reformers both protestant and catholic. The idea of an indulgence for sin has long precedent in Catholic theology, but in the early sixteenth century indulgences were sold to raise money for large-scale building projects and expensive art. The money to pay Michelangelo for the Sistine Chapel, for example, came in large part from the sale of indulgences. Church officials living luxuriously while demanding money from their parishioners are a perennial problem, but were an especially acute one on the eve of the Reformation.</p>

<p>However, even as many in church leadership were more concerned with earthly power and wealth than the care of souls, the growing middle class in Europe eagerly sought opportunities for spiritual growth. More people had basic literacy and the time for devotion, leading to widespread interest in spirituality across Europe — and widespread concern about the corruption in the church. After all, reform arises most effectively from groups who genuinely care about the health of the institution they seek to reform, and the Reformation is no exception.</p>

<p>Moreover, renaissance humanism was spreading across Europe. This was primarily a system of education with a strong emphasis on Greek literature and an equally strong sense of distance from, and recovery of, the classical past. (This sense of rupture from the past differs from the medieval sense of continuity with the Latin past.) The shifting attitudes of renaissance humanism meant a greater willingness to question authority and a larger emphasis on the individual conscience, laying the foundation for several centuries of disruption to the old accepted orders of both religion and politics.</p>

<p>So in the early sixteenth century, we see the convergence of corruption in church leadership with vibrant interest in spiritual growth and with an educational program willing to question tradition. In this environment, the question of reform is not if, but when and how. And here again, Luther may be retrospectively the most dramatic reformer, but he was hardly alone in his criticisms of the church. Three years before Luther&rsquo;s Theses, for example, the scholar Erasmus published (anonymously) a blistering satire about Julius II, self-explanatorily titled <em>Julius Excluded from Heaven.</em> Moreover, Luther&rsquo;s 95 Theses weren&rsquo;t meant to be a dramatic exit from the church but rather an opening salvo in a dialogue aimed at reform.</p>

<p>However, Luther&rsquo;s theses did challenge the authority of the pope and were thus poorly received by church leaders in Germany and Rome, beginning the road towards Luther&rsquo;s excommunication and the establishment of the Lutheran church. The political situation in Germany aided this process; because of the pope&rsquo;s involvement with the Holy Roman Emperor, many German princes within the Holy Roman Empire were happy to find a new way to oppose their emperor and stop the flow of land and money to the church. Some German princes who became Lutheran certainly had a genuine interest in Luther&rsquo;s theology, but the spread of Lutheranism owed much to its political usefulness at this particular moment in time in the German provinces of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>None of this undermines the importance of Luther, or of the Reformation. But as we protestants celebrate the birth of our movement, we should remember that protestants didn&rsquo;t rediscover Christianity, or succeed in separating their churches from national politics and the corruption that follows. (The only Christians advocating the separation of church and state in the sixteenth century were the anabaptists, and if the Lutherans, Calvinists and Catholics could agree on one thing, it was that the anabaptists were the worst.)</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s also worth pausing on the title &ldquo;Reformation,&rdquo; because what happened wasn&rsquo;t a reformation, but a schism. Those reformers who remained Catholic successfully ended many abuses of the leadership, but the damage was already done and the western church had split into factions.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> As a modern western protestant in a democratic nation that highly values individualism, I sympathize with those who form their own churches based on doctrinal convictions. But I also wonder what we lose when we choose to separate rather than do the hard work of re-learning how to live together.</p>

<p>In the last few years, Lutherans and Catholics have joined together to celebrate the anniversary of the Reformation. These joint celebrations serve as examples of how we can work together as Christians across denomination lines, remembering that above all we are the body of Christ despite the disagreements that inevitably arise in any family.</p>

<p>Luther almost certainly sent his document to the Archbishop of Mainz on this date, who forwarded the theses to Rome on the suspicion of heresy.

            <title>Buffy Appreciation Day</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Halloween, I have declared today Buffy Appreciation Day on the blog. If you&rsquo;re not a fan, or if you are still worried about spoilers after 20 years, come back on Wednesday when regular programming returns!</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">

</figure></p>

<p>I know some Christians object to shows like <em>Buffy</em> on the basis of its portrayals of demons and witches. And, well, redeemable demons aren&rsquo;t really a part of Christian theology:</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3IIYNhdBbXOpO/giphy.gif" alt="Spike" />
</figure></p>

<p>Oh, you thought I meant this one?</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/12InM1j6rZ7JFC/giphy.gif" alt="Angel" />
</figure></p>

<p>If you think being cursed with a soul counts as redeemable …</p>

<p>And Willow is certainly one of the world&rsquo;s most adorable witches.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MagubuxVFLgiI/giphy.gif" alt="Willow floating a pencil" />
</figure></p>

<p>Until she isn&rsquo;t, of course.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/akzLz42Jle50I/giphy.gif" alt="Dark Willow" />
</figure></p>

<p>But in terms of larger themes, Buffy repeatedly risks her life to save others, dying and coming back to life not just once but two separate times.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">

</figure></p>

<p>Buffy relies on friends …</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ercPDtdVvoeFa/giphy.gif" alt="Willow and Xander" />
</figure></p>

<p>… her mentor Giles …</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">

</figure></p>

<p>… frenemies …</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ObLbn7K4JoUPS/giphy.gif" alt="Faith" />
</figure></p>

<p>… and her family as she repeatedly averts the apocalypse.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">

</figure></p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZSNFhAZCqq4ne/giphy.gif" alt="Buffy and Dawn" />
</figure></p>

<p>Buffy has too many moments of hilarity and terror, too many heart-wrenching episodes, for me to even try to appreciate them all.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/u8PVshw9v73ws/giphy.gif" alt="Cordelia has a life" />
</figure></p>

<p>But for me, the core of the show is the relationships, the people who band together to help Buffy. The gimmick that launched the show is a reversal of the horror trope in which the cute blond cheerleader is the first to die; Buffy, of course, becomes the cute blond cheerleader who kills the monsters.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Lm92CPyMeEIjm/giphy.gif" alt="Buffy with a lollipop" />
</figure></p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/N6plJ19KVtvoc/giphy.gif" alt="Buffy gives monsters nightmares" />
</figure></p>

<p>The gimmick isn&rsquo;t the heart of the show, however. The heart is the subversion of the lone hero trope, as Buffy and Giles both slowly come to accept that Buffy can&rsquo;t save the world alone — she needs her friends, and as the series concludes she needs a whole army of slayers.</p>

<p>The finale of season 6 illustrates Buffy&rsquo;s limitations as a lone hero and the strength of friendship: Buffy&rsquo;s powers can&rsquo;t stop Dark Willow — but Xander&rsquo;s dedicated loyalty and love bring Willow back to herself.</p>

<p>All the feels.</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/HiNAVRIugIr4Y/giphy.gif" alt="Xander and Dark Willow" />
</figure></p>

<p><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> isn&rsquo;t a perfect show. But I love it because of its heart, because if the apocalypse ever arrives I want Buffy and her crew in my corner.</p>

<p>Or if this guy ever shows up at my door:</p>

<p><figure class="text-center">

<p>I ended <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-25-2017-womens-value">Wednesday&rsquo;s post</a> with the paradox at the heart of complementarian theology: that God views women as equal to men, but nevertheless has placed them in a position of permanent subordination to men. Complementarians like Piper don&rsquo;t seem to see the problems in this paradox, however; they insist that being inferior in <em>position</em> is not the same things as being inferior by <em>nature</em>, or ontologically.</p>

<p>Of course, a woman&rsquo;s nature is what places her in the position of inferiority to begin with, leaving the easy inference that our nature is indeed inferior. Either that, or God is arbitrary: for no reason other than a lack of male genitalia, we women are barred from leading and teaching men, even if we have the gifts and talents to do so.</p>

<p>In short, despite Piper&rsquo;s insistence that God values women as much as men, complementarian theology undercuts this equality. And as I discussed on Wednesday, this subordination of women is exacerbated because men, in this theology, retain all the power. They lead in churches and in families, and are given the power of the final decision. They have both positional authority as husbands and pastors and real power over the members of their households or churches. Women are to affirm this leadership and partner with it, but not take on these roles themselves.</p>

<p>Now, I want to be careful here: many Christians affirm this theological position without adhering to it at all times. I know marriages in which the spouses intellectually affirm male headship, but practically function as egalitarians, sharing decisions, responsibilities, and power. I have been part of a church in which women couldn&rsquo;t be the head pastor, and yet they served, led and taught at every other level of the church. Ideologies have power and can be damaging even when not fully implemented, but I want to be clear that many, and probably most, Christian men don&rsquo;t intentionally abuse the position this reading of scripture gives them.</p>

<p>However, any theology that permanently places women in subordinate positions on the basis of their biological sex alone has the potential to be harmful.</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to maintain an intellectual distinction between inferiority of position and inferiority of nature, especially when that inferior position comes directly from nature. Thus women are viewed as inferior to men: physically weaker, emotionally less stable, analytically less capable.</p>

<p>In this attitude, the church is no different from the surrounding culture. The same perceptions keep women out of pulpits and C-suites, teaching roles and senate seats, finance committees and tech companies. And both complementarians and secular people fall back on the same excuse, that women aren&rsquo;t inferior — just different. But when &ldquo;different&rdquo; overwhelmingly means &ldquo;not as good as&rdquo; and &ldquo;subordinate,&rdquo; women are left not only feeling but also being treated as less valuable than men.</p>

<p>This attitude harms both individual women and the church as a body. Relying on stereotypes of women, and particularly those stereotypes that make them inferior to men, means that the church misses out on many gifts and talents. The college professor may be shunted to children&rsquo;s Sunday school rather than encouraged to teach adults. The brilliant accountant may be pushed to lead the bake sale rather than the finance team. The non-profit director may be asked to volunteer in the nursery rather than on the leadership team.</p>

<p>Enshrining stereotypes as God&rsquo;s plan, especially when these stereotypes are combined with prohibitions on women leading and teaching men, means that talent and passion can get overlooked. And women do notice: they may continue to attend and serve, or they may leave, but they know that their gifts have been judged as not good enough for the church because of their gender. So individuals have been harmed, and the church body has also been harmed.</p>

<p>Second, and more seriously, viewing women as inferior and subordinate makes abuse more likely and makes male church leaders less likely to take that abuse seriously. As I said above, most complementarian men don&rsquo;t abuse their power. But I have heard and read story after story of women told to stay in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-18/domestic-violence-church-submit-to-husbands/8652028">abusive marriages</a>, of women <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/02/01/the-strange-case-of-the-pastor-released-from-iran-and-his-wifes-abuse-allegations/?utm_term=.221ac7416aeb">not believed</a> when they come forward with reports of assault, of women silenced and <a href="http://thewartburgwatch.com/2017/09/23/janes-traumatic-rape-and-subsequent-mistreatment-by-officials-at-the-masters-college-now-university/">shamed</a>. I have stories from my time as a professor at a Christian college that I can&rsquo;t share but that still make me rage.</p>

<p>If men are more important than women, their word is more trustworthy and their reputation is more valuable. This leaves women alone, vulnerable, hurting, doubting their own experiences and making light of their own pain. Complementarian theology doesn&rsquo;t condone abuse, but it creates the environment in which abuse can happen with few consequences for the abuser.</p>

<p>I believe that complementarians misread several key passages from scripture, but I want to end today&rsquo;s post by returning to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 5</a>, one of the key passages on which John Piper bases his assertion that men are to lead. This passage begins in verse 21, with the command for Christians to submit to one another, before moving into marriage specifically. Wives are told to submit to their husbands in verse 22, and in verse 25 husbands are told to love their wives as Christ loved the church &ldquo;and gave himself up for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the context of mutual submission (verse 21), this verse implies something rather different from top-down leadership. The phrasing of giving oneself up for another obviously refers to Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross, but it also evokes another passage: <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 2</a>. In this passage, Paul describes how Christ &ldquo;made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness&rdquo; (v. 7).</p>

<p>Christ is, by nature and position, superior to the church — he is God, and the church is not. And yet he becomes human because of his love for his people. Similarly, in first-century Rome husbands were considered superior to their wives both legally and by nature. Paul asks husbands in Ephesians 5 to sacrifice their superiority as Christ sacrificed his for the church; he encourages them to love their wives as they love themselves — as equals to themselves.</p>

<p>The analogy with Christ breaks down here, of course, because Paul suggests that men and women are actually equal in the eyes of God. But because men are not superior by nature, they are to imitate Christ and lay down their superior position in mutual submission to their wives. Today, unlike in Paul&rsquo;s Rome, American men have not held legal superiority in their marriages for several decades. And yet complementarian theology tells husbands to hold on to their superior position, contrary to Paul and America&rsquo;s legal system.</p>

<p>As I read this Ephesians passage, Paul assumes the equal standing of men and women in the eyes of God, and because of this he directs men to lay down their positional superiority. That is, men are not to be superior to women in position because they are not superior by nature, which means that women ought to be treated as equals rather than relegated to inferior positions. Ephesians 5 talks about marriage specifically, not church leadership. But it establishes that men and women are equal in value while asking men to lay down the superiority granted them by a patriarchal culture.</p>

<p>However, complementarianism argues that men have the superior position, even if not the superior nature. Because this distinction is difficult to maintain, especially in face of pervasive cultural misogyny, women are treated as inferiors and this causes harm to women and the church on a variety of levels. In response, the church needs to actively cultivate an environment in which women are taken seriously and treated as full human beings equal to men both by nature and in the positions they can occupy. Abuse will never be fully eradicated, but a theology that makes women inferior cannot address the conditions in which abuse flourishes.</p>]]></description>

<p>When I wrote about the #MeToo movement <a href="https://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-18-2017-me-too">last week</a>, I looked at attitudes towards women in America broadly. But the church is often no better than the surrounding culture at valuing women as human beings, and this tendency is exacerbated by complementarian theologies that affirm male headship and male leadership.</p>

<p>I found a perfect example of this tendency earlier this year in an episode of &ldquo;Ask Pastor John,&rdquo; John Piper&rsquo;s podcast in which he addresses theological questions. In <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/are-men-superior-to-women">this episode</a>, Piper attempts to reassure a woman who finds that complementarian theology intensifies her feelings of inferiority to the men around her. Here is her question in full:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Hello Pastor John, my name is Jennifer and I live on Long Island. I have a question about complementarianism. It is something I have struggled with for a long time, and it is something I need to have worked out before even considering a relationship or marriage in the future. I know the Bible clearly states that men and women are equal in their standing before God as far as salvation. But in other areas of life I still struggle with feelings of inferiority, because of certain comparisons used in the Bible. For example, regarding submission, the Bible says that the servant is not greater than his master, and wives are called to submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ. However, servants are not equal to their masters, and the church is not equal in worth to Christ. In almost every area of life, those in positions of authority are considered more valuable than those under that authority. Just like the President is more valued than the secret service men, and in businesses, managers are more valued than the workers under them, and throughout history women have always been treated as less valuable than men. In light of these things, I greatly struggle with feeling inferior in worth to men. Is there something that you might be able to see that I am missing, as I read through Scripture? Thank you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In his response, Piper rightfully affirms the equal standing of men and women before God. But from there, his answer highlights the ways in which complementarian theology cannot address Jennifer’s concerns and instead reinforces the inferior position of women, largely because Piper refuses to acknowledge the way we humans perceive and value leaders and followers.</p>

<p>First, Piper begins with the question of whether men and women are truly equal. He points out the biological differences between men and women: men tend to be larger and stronger, while only women are capable of bearing children. After an unfounded dig at the scientific community for allegedly obscuring other differences between genders, Piper concludes that the sum total of the “superiorities and inferiorities” of men and women is equal.</p>

<p>On one level, despite sniping at studies of gender differences (which not only exist but permeate pop culture psychologies of men and women), Piper is right. Men and women have different biologies; men&rsquo;s greater testosterone levels give them an undeniable strength advantage, and obviously possessing a uterus is a prerequisite of childbearing. How, and even if, these biological differences affect other differences — in language, analysis, emotion, etc. — is much less clear, but biological differences without a doubt play a large role in our experiences in the world.</p>

<p>On another level, however, Piper&rsquo;s point is so broad as to be almost meaningless. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and no one person is good at all the things — regardless of gender. Imagining each gender with a balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses that ultimately even out seems odd and unnecessary when we could simply say that everyone is different, due to complex mixes of biology and sociology. Regardless of their personal strengths and weaknesses, each person is created in the image of God and valued by God as much as any other human being.</p>

<p>Moreover, imagining a balance sheet for each gender erases the way in which society <em>values</em> these differences, biological or conditioned. We can argue that intuitive thinking is as valuable as rational thinking, or cooperative leadership as valuable as command leadership, but are we under any illusions about which one is valued more in society? And which one is associated with women?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pick on Piper too much in this point, since he is fully affirming the equality of men and women in the eyes of God. But he misses the point that society values men and women differently, and that the church tends to follow suit. We see this clearly in Jennifer&rsquo;s letter: she feels inferior because society has been telling her that she is inferior to men and then, when she turns to the church and the complementarian interpretation of the bible, she does not find a different message.</p>

<p>In short, I agree with Piper&rsquo;s point that God loves men and women equally. But this isn&rsquo;t really Jennifer&rsquo;s problem; she is concerned that the very human and socially embedded institution of the church sees her as inferior, and Piper&rsquo;s response has, up to this point, failed to address that issue.</p>

<p>And he continues to fail to address Jennifer&rsquo;s sense of inferiority in a meaningful way. Piper next turns to the scripture passages that particularly trouble Jennifer, those about servants and masters and about marriage reflecting Christ and the church. In the context of servants and masters, Piper reads these passages as affirming the spiritual equality of servants, thus sidestepping the question of superiority and inferiority. I wish that Piper had made explicit what seems to be his implicit point: the master-servant dynamic is socially constructed and thus cannot reflect the value of a person. But this argument would become problematic for his reading of Ephesians 5, in which male headship is God-ordained rather than a more malleable social construction.</p>

<p>When Piper turns to the Ephesians 5 passage about marriage, he reinforces the socially imposed power structures of Greco-Roman marriages. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>“owing to God’s design in creation, the point of comparison [between Christ and the Church] is that godly, mature manhood and womanhood are of such a nature that they both experience a sense of fitness and suitableness and appropriateness in the roles of manhood as humble leadership and protection and provision and womanhood as gladly affirming that leadership and partnering with a man in the use of her gifts to carry it through — and whether that fitness lies in some overall superiority or inferiority need not be implied in this text about husbands and wives. I don’t think it is implied.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is hardly a resounding affirmation of the equality of men and women. In her question, Jennifer is struggling with the fact that leaders are seen as more important than those who are lead — and with the fact that her female anatomy bars her from leadership roles. Piper reaffirms that men are to be the leaders and then asserts that this doesn&rsquo;t imply superiority. But the problem is that in our society, as in the apostle Paul&rsquo;s, leaders are valued above followers.</p>

<p>In many realms of life, this valuation of leaders doesn&rsquo;t leave followers feeling inferior; most of us have a variety of roles in which we may lead or follow, and those roles are fluid as we progress in careers or take on new responsibilities. But when someone is barred from a leadership position on the basis of some quality beyond their control — like sex or race — it&rsquo;s almost impossible not to see that prohibition as an indication of inferiority.</p>

<p>Following what he says about servants and masters, Piper could have noted that loving one’s wife as Christ loved the church is a distinct subversion of the power dynamic that Paul’s audience would have expected between husbands and wives. Even if a marriage outwardly conformed to first-century Roman norms, telling husbands to lead in mutual submission to their wives (Eph. 5:21) and in imitation of Christ’s self-sacrificing love subverts the power dynamic of leader and follower, or superior and inferior.</p>

<p>But Piper doesn’t say this. He simply affirms that men are to lead and women are to follow, asserting that couples who follow this pattern will find a sense of “fitness” in these roles that, apparently, mirrors the fitness we feel as Christians following Christ. Piper ignores the value we place on leadership and, by extension, leaders. Moreover, Piper isn&rsquo;t merely granting nominal leadership, as Paul may do — that is, the position of leader without the power. He intends for men to have the power in the relationship: the power of the final decision, the power implied in protection and provision. Women are excluded from that power on the basis of their biological sex alone.</p>

<p>Piper thinks that Jennifer can and should believe two things simultaneously: that God sees her as the equal of men, and that God has decreed that she must only follow and support men. He believes that the value gained in the first belief negates any inferiority implied in the second; or, that if Jennifer&rsquo;s sense of inferiority lingers, it should be vanquished by the belief that this arrangement is God&rsquo;s good plan. But his inability to consider either the social value placed on leaders (one held by the church no less than the world) or to consider the implications of the power dynamic means that he cannot assure Jennifer that she isn&rsquo;t actually inferior.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Piper can only answer that God intends for women to be in a position not only judged by society as inferior but also truly lesser in terms of power and influence, while still insisting that this doesn&rsquo;t make women <em>actually</em> inferior to men in the eyes of God. This paradox at the core of complementarian theology leaves women like Jennifer feeling less than men and prevents leaders like Piper from acknowledging the harm caused by their theology. And I will turn to this harm in Friday&rsquo;s post.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Women in Christian Theology: Catherine of Siena</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is the first in a recurring series on women in theology. My goal in this series is not highlight exceptional women but instead to look at the many contributions of women, some well known and others that frequently go unremarked or overlooked.</em></p>

<p>It comes as a surprise to many that medieval women made substantial contributions to theology. Our popular image of the middle ages emphasizes its darkness and ignorance, which surely (we assume) includes the oppression of women. But medieval women did have avenues of influence in the church, and even the briefest survey of Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s life shows both her political and her theological influence.</p>

<p>Born in 1347, the year the plague swept into Europe, middle-class Catherine grew up to become an important figure in Italian politics and a mystic theologian. Accounts of her life report that she began having mystic visions as a child of 5 or 6, visions that continued throughout her life. But Catherine hardly secluded herself in order to experience these visions; she lived an active life both within her community and beyond it, in the realm of Italian politics.</p>

<p>When Catherine was 16, she refused a marriage her parents had attempted to arrange and instead became a tertiary in the Dominican order. A tertiary in a monastic order lives a life in accordance with the vows of monasticism (poverty, chastity, obedience) but does not actually take those vows. Catherine was probably attracted to living a monastic life without being secluded in a cloister, as she would have been were she a Dominican nun. She did, however, spend the next three years praying and fasting before she reemerged into public life.</p>

<p>From the time she was 19 until her early death at 33 (in 1380), Catherine served her community in a variety of ways. She worked with the poor and the sick, giving away her own food and tending plague victims. In her mid-20s, Catherine began to travel in Italy and to write letters to a variety of important Italians, offering advice and urging peace between warring Italian cities. Nearly 400 of these letters still survive. Even as she became involved in politics, however, her role was primarily that of a spiritual advisor, encouraging repentance and renewal.</p>

<p>As her influence in Italian politics grew, Catherine became involved in the complex politics around the Avignon Papacy. In 1309, long before Catherine&rsquo;s birth, the papacy had relocated from Rome to Avignon, France under pressure from French rulers. This move caused significant distress in the church, and Catherine&rsquo;s voice joined a chorus begging the pope to return to Rome. She herself travelled to Avignon in 1376 and met with Pope Gregory XI, where she urged him to return to Rome. Catherine was not the only influence in his decision, but Gregory XI did indeed return to Rome in 1377 — although much to Catherine&rsquo;s dismay, within a year this move precipitated a schism in the church, with one pope in Rome and another in Avignon.</p>

<p>In the brief period between the return of Gregory XI and the schism, Catherine produced her treatise, <em>The Dialogue.</em> She seems to have dictated much of it while having visions, but she likely learned to write in order to edit her own text.  Reading and writing were distinct skills in the middle ages, and Catherine seems to have relied on scribes to write while she dictated her letters. But she evidently wanted a greater degree of control over the text of <em>The Dialogue,</em> which points to its importance as a record of her mystical experiences.</p>

<p>Like most medieval mystic theology, <em>The Dialogue</em> both records Catherine&rsquo;s mystical visions and reflects theologically on them. Particularly striking imagery fills the conclusion, as Catherine uses an almost dizzying array of images and metaphors to describe God. In just a few paragraphs, God is the deep sea, a burning fire, the abyss, a craftsman, light, a mirror, and a garment. Through these images, Catherine attempts to describe her understanding of God in a spirit of humble awe at the revelations she has received. Her images pile up, overlap, some harmonious, some discordant — but all point towards the depth of God&rsquo;s love for humanity and the overwhelming but good nature of God.</p>

<p>Catherine died in 1380, physically worn down by years of fasting and deeply disappointed by the emerging schism in the church. Her life was short but full: in her brief 33 years, she meet with rulers and popes, persuading them to restore peace and return the papacy to its rightful home. But above all this, she frequently experienced the direct presence of God. Her <em>Dialogue</em> meditates on these experiences, attempting to explain the magnitude of God&rsquo;s love and the necessity of responding to it, despite our inability to ever reflect God.</p>

<p>Catherine was revered immediately upon her death, and sainted in 1461. And her legacy has continued: in 1970, Catherine was named a Doctor of the Church, an honor given to 36 men and women (currently) who made significant contributions to theology. Also, in 1999, Pope John Paul II named Catherine one of the six patron saints of Europe.</p>

<p>Despite her brief life, Catherine brilliantly exemplifies how we can combine the active and contemplative lives. Her involvement in both charity work close to home and Italian politics reflect her rich direct experiences with God as she strove to bring the peace and love of God to those around her, while urging them to respond to that peace and love with repentance and renewal.</p>]]></description>

<p>By happy coincidence, last week I was reading both Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s <em>Delusions of Gender</em> and Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s essay collection <em>The Givenness of Things</em>, which begins with &ldquo;Humanism.&rdquo; In this essay, Robinson considers the limitations of neuroscience, which she describes as reducing the intricate complexity of the brain to &ldquo;an essentially simple thing.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This reduction, in Robinson&rsquo;s analysis, rejects the notion of the self and ultimately results in a devaluation of humanity.</p>

<p>Cordelia Fine&rsquo;s book is a little less intellectually lofty, but she also takes popular neuroscience to task, specifically for oversimplifying and overstating complex and often unclear results about differences between men and women. Fine&rsquo;s more narrow argument supports Robinson&rsquo;s larger point: when neuroscience is used to support sweeping generalizations about gender differences, both men and women are dehumanized, their potentials and limitations reduced to electrical impulses in their brains.</p>

<p>Fine argues, repeatedly, that a focus on the brain alone erases the many social factors that lead men and women to behave and respond differently — in other words, neuroscientists tend to study brains as isolated rather than embedded in complex social networks. Reading Fine in conjunction with Robinson, we can criticize the tendencies of neuroscience, or at the very least reporting on neuroscience, to ignore the impact of both sociology and the humanities on our understanding of the self.</p>

<p>But why does this tendency to view the brain in isolation from society and the humanities matter? After all, neuroscience has the very specific goal of discovering how the brain works in a mechanical sense, exploring topics like where and how emotions manifest and whether differences exist between male and female brains. Any area of study must have its limitations, and as Robinson points out the very nature of science over the last two hundred years or so bars it from asking metaphysical questions about the soul, or even the self.</p>

<p>Fine and Robinson both take different angles on the question of why the limited focus of neuroscience is a problem, but both broadly criticize it for its overreach, the tendency to take a specific test result and make sweeping generalities about human nature. For Fine, the overreach lies in how neuroscience affirms and entrenches our tired old stereotypes of women — with the veneer of objective scientific truth but without consideration of the effect of centuries of patriarchy. For Robinson, the overreach lies in oversimplification, the notion that we can understand humanity by tracing where the brain lights up in a scanner. Both authors resist the essentializing of ourselves to the mechanisms of our brains, or at least to those mechanisms described in simple, cause-and-effect terms.</p>

<p>Neuroscience is just the latest in an extensive human tendency to oversimplify and essentialize human beings. Long before brain scans and modern neuroscience, the author Charlotte Brontë warns against reducing complex individuals to the mere sum of their parts. In Brontë&rsquo;s novel <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Jane makes a passionate speech to Mr. Rochester in which she proclaims: &ldquo;Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you, — and full as much heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brontë may not have had brain scans, but she was familiar with the nineteenth-century methods of essentializing people by class and gender. Given the social norms of the day, the wealthy, upper-class, male Mr. Rochester had every reason to believe that poor, lower-class, female Jane was, indeed, lacking in soul and heart, lacking in those characteristics that make one fully human.</p>

<p>Jane&rsquo;s declaration reminds Mr. Rochester — and us, dear reader — that Jane herself, her desires and talents and emotions and capabilities, cannot be boiled down to her class, gender, and dare I say brain scans. Brontë&rsquo;s heart-wrenching narrative of Jane&rsquo;s childhood emphasizes her extraordinary passion and sensitivity despite an upbringing designed to squash those characteristics.</p>

<p>And so, despite all the inputs that should push her to develop a poor, mean character, Jane clings to a self that is kind, generous, <em>good</em>, a self that is shaped by her circumstances but not in a mechanical, cause-and-effect manner. Yet she knows that when people see her, they often see not her unique self but the presumed product of poverty, charity and femininity — a product endowed with less heart and soul than an upper-class man.</p>

<p>Neuroscience has a similar tendency, reducing the complex web of the self to a measurable series of stimuli and responses. Neuroscience has, to be sure, great value: for example, understanding how stress can reshape our brains can give us greater empathy for those who encounter the daily stress of poverty or racism.</p>

<p>But Robinson and Fine, along with all the great novelists, remind us that we cannot reduce humans to their brain chemistry. Social context matters greatly, especially since brain science is still in its infancy. Even social context, though, cannot fully account for the self. For that, we must turn to the humanities to understand what it means to have a soul, to have a heart — to have those qualities that poor, little, obscure Jane claims, qualities that make her an equal to any other human being.</p>

<p>I think most of would agree that our self is something more than the chemistry or electrical impulses in our physical brains. And to understand something as complex and metaphysical of the self, we must not limit ourselves to neuroscience. Instead, we must draw on the resources of social science and the humanities as we strive to understand what it means to be human.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t wanted to write about Harvey Weinstein. Not because I don&rsquo;t care, or don&rsquo;t believe the accusations, or have nothing to say, but because I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m not shocked. I&rsquo;m not surprised. I&rsquo;m horrified, of course, although that reaction is dulled by too many repetitions of the same story.</p>

<p>But with #MeToo trending on Twitter as I write today, I feel the need to say something. It&rsquo;s not going to be something profound. It&rsquo;s not going to be the something that suddenly changes things for women. But it&rsquo;s one more something on the mound of stories and arguments and pleas that, maybe, someday, will grow into change.</p>

<p>When I say me too, I know I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones: I&rsquo;ve never been sexually assaulted. Just harassed. Just made to feel uncomfortable, just grateful to the friends — men and women — who&rsquo;ve looked out for me over the years, walking me to my car at night, warning me about the too-friendly professor, watching my drink at the bar.</p>

<p>In other words, just a typical woman.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem: I don&rsquo;t know any woman who hasn&rsquo;t experienced harassment in some form. It&rsquo;s everywhere, but that also means it&rsquo;s nowhere. Invisible.</p>

<p>Something like the allegations about Harvey Weinstein break onto the scene, and everyone is horrified. For a while. But we all know the pattern, because it happens so often: we feel outrage, but it seldom translates into an examination of why this keeps happening.</p>

<p>We start to distance ourselves. We chalk assault up to Hollywood culture. We have a hard time reconciling a genial figure peddling pudding in dorky sweaters with a habitual user of date rape drugs. We dismiss crude language about assaulting women as locker-room talk.</p>

<p>We wonder why women don&rsquo;t speak up about their experiences sooner, or louder, or somehow better. We read <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kMJV4o">op-eds</a> that suggest this sort of harassment happens to pretty women, less conservative women, women with less protective parents. We make this a liberal problem (Weinstein) or a conservative one (Roger Ailes), a worldly problem (Hugh Hefner) or a religious one (Bill Gothard).</p>

<p>As women, we are told and we tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re too sensitive, we can&rsquo;t take a joke, we&rsquo;re imagining things, we should be flattered by the attention. If we&rsquo;re careful enough, if we smile and nod, if we wear the right things and say the right things we&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Besides, how often does that sort of thing <em>really</em> happen?</p>

<p>And before we know it, we&rsquo;re back to normal — and maybe a career has ended, but more often nothing much happens and nothing much changes.</p>

<p>If we want this cycle to change, we must confront the fact that, as a society, we value women less than men. We find their pain less important than men&rsquo;s reputations. We believe them less, we subject them to greater scrutiny, we hold them to impossibly high standards.</p>

<p>This happens in churches and faith-based organization and in Hollywood. In academia and service industries. On the coasts and in rural Iowa. In Silicon Valley, in hospitals, in the C-suite, in factories. Women are harassed and assaulted by strangers and trusted friends, by colleagues and intimate partners, by bosses and subordinates.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m tired of people being periodically horrified by high-profile instances of assault. I want people to be horrified that half the population has to deal with harassment on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I want outrage and official action over the professors who have inappropriate contact with their students, not just a whisper network among women.</p>

<p>I want the comedian who tells a rape joke to hear horrified gasps, not laughter.</p>

<p>I want the pastor who delivers sexist jokes from the pulpit to be corrected by his parishioners, not allowed to persist.</p>

<p>I want the manager who touches inappropriately to be reprimanded, not ignored.</p>

<p>I want the colleague who makes off-color remarks to be ostracized, not excused.</p>

<p>I want the phrase &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo; stricken from our vocabulary.</p>

<p>I want to stop feeling so damn thankful that I&rsquo;ve only been harassed, not assaulted.</p>

<p>But until we work up the will as a culture to value women as human beings whose worth is equal to men, none of what I want will happen.</p>]]></description>

            <title>La La Land and Loss</title>

</figure></p>

<p>(Spoilers throughout)</p>

<p>I watched <em>La La Land</em> for the first time last week. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sold: I was a little bored by the meet cute, the mutual dislike opener to the romantic relationship, the aspiring actress falling for the snobby, nostalgic lover of jazz. But the ending? That got to me.</p>

<p>I must confess that I&rsquo;m a sucker for the unresolved ending, the ending where plot threads dangle and the happily-ever-afters dissolve into uncertainty. And <em>La La Land</em> subverts the ending we expect of a romantic comedy in ways that underscore the tensions between individuals and relationships and highlight the loss that always comes with the choices we make.</p>

<p>In the final dream sequence of the film, we see Emma Stone&rsquo;s character (Mia) imagine a different path for her relationship with Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling). The power of this dream sequence is that we, the viewers, want it to be true: the conventional romantic narrative of the majority of the film sets us up to want Mia and Sebastian to get to happily ever after together. Sebastian living alone, Mia married to another man — these do no make for a Hollywood ending. The dream sequence feels right, feels like the ending we deserve.</p>

<p>And yet. The dream sequence is a fantasy: it waves away the conflict between Mia and Sebastian, and not just the initial romantic attraction disguised as repulsion. It erases Sebastian&rsquo;s time with the band, erases his failure to come to Mia&rsquo;s one-woman show, erases their separation when Mia goes to Paris to star in a movie … and erases Sebastian&rsquo;s successful opening of his dream jazz club.</p>

<p>This dream sequence underscores the vital tension in the film between the relationship and the individual dreams of Mia and Sebastian: they can&rsquo;t have it all. They can&rsquo;t have each other while also fulfilling their separate dreams.</p>

<p><em>La La Land</em> layers the expectation of romantic comedies — that the relationship prevails — with the other prevailing film expectation that the characters follow their individual dreams. Sebastian tells Mia not to turn down the film in Paris because of him, and she doesn&rsquo;t. She ends up with the successful acting career she wanted, as well as a husband and child with whom she seems very happy. And Sebastian doesn&rsquo;t find a romantic partner, but he remains close to his sister and her family as he launches his own jazz club.</p>

<p>They have followed their dreams, they are both happy — but the final sequence underscores the cost, highlights what could have been had they made different choices. The film doesn&rsquo;t suggest that they have made wrong choices; the final look between Mia and Sebastian contains acceptance, not unhappiness. But this look also acknowledges the inevitable loss of making a choice.</p>

<p>What is the cost of pursuing your own dreams, of valuing your individuality over relationships, or even a single relationship? Is the cost worth what you gain? <em>La La Land</em> doesn&rsquo;t answer these questions, refuses to answer these questions — at the end of the film, both the future that is and the future that could have been are good. But the film forces us to ask that question.</p>

<p>Unlike most romantic comedies, where the characters either do end up having it all or where any individual loss is minimized compared to the relationship, <em>La La Land</em> forces us to consider what we value and what we lose in our choices. The film presents no solution, no formula for making these calculations. But the power of the ending lies in its acknowledgement of loss, its realization of the cost of the always inevitable choice between individual and relationship.</p>]]></description>

<p>After all the medieval history, today we take an autumn-appropriate breath with some Old English poetry. The poem partially quoted below, <em>The Ruin</em>, is an elegy, a lament for things lost. Old English poetry has a rich selection of elegies, and this is one of my favorites. It comes from a tenth-century manuscript known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Book">Exeter book</a>, the largest of only a few surviving collections of Old English literature.</p>

<p>The poem itself, in the tradition of an elegy, meditates on ruins and the inevitable decay of all earthly things. In a fittingly poetic twist, the manuscript itself is also damaged, leaving the poem about ruins in ruins.</p>

<p>In a season overrun with decorative gourds and pumpkin spice delicacies that distract us from the coming winter, it&rsquo;s worth reflecting for a moment on falls, on ends, on decay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wondrous is this wall&rsquo;s foundation – <em>wyrd</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> has broken</p>

<p>and shattered this city; the work of giants crumbles.</p>

<p>The roofs are ruined, the towers toppled,</p>

<p>frost in the mortar has broken the gate,</p>

<p>torn and worn and shorn by the storm,</p>

<p>eaten through with age. The earth’s grasp</p>

<p>holds the builders, rotten, forgotten,</p>

<p>the hard grip of the ground, until a hundred</p>

<p>generations of men are gone.</p>

<p>This wall, rust-stained</p>

<p>and covered with moss, has endured one kingdom after another,</p>

<p>stood in the storm, steep and tall, then tumbled.</p>

<p>The foundation remains, felled by the weather,</p>

<p>it fell…..<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>grimly ground up ….</p>

<p>……cleverly created….</p>

<p>…… a crust of mud surrounded …</p>

<p>….. put together a swift</p>

<p>and subtle system of rings; one of great wisdom</p>

<p>wondrously bound the braces together with wires.</p></blockquote>

</figure></p>

<p>The poem continues with descriptions of the inhabitants of this ruin, proud warriors who succumbed to plague and war despite their joy and bravery while they lived:</p>

<blockquote><p>The slain fell on all sides, plague-days came,</p>

<p>and death destroyed all the brave swordsmen;</p>

<p>the seats of their idols became empty wasteland,</p>

<p>the city crumbled, its re-builders collapsed</p>

<p>beside their shrines. So now these courts are empty,</p>

<p>and the rich vaults of the vermilion roofs</p>

<p>shed their tiles.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Unlike other Old English elegies, <em>The Ruin</em> has no explicitly Christian themes, no reference to the eternal nature of God. It&rsquo;s a poem about a lost civilization (most scholars connect it to the Roman ruins in modern-day Bath), and as such a reminder that all civilizations come to an end. Reading it today, in the twenty-first century, we have an added layer of poignancy: the author and his culture have crumbled into the ruins of history, the poem itself existing in ruins — a memorial, as were the Roman ruins, to those who produced them.</p>

<p>This probably seems like an odd way to end a series that attempts to reclaim the middle ages from those who would distort them in the service of damaging ideologies. And I could have chosen any number of other cultural relics that are more up-beat, more exemplary of the rich and diverse culture of the middle ages.</p>

<p>But at the beginning of this series, I talked about the culture wars as a fight to define and defend western culture — and those actions require that we also preserve western culture. Against this urge for preservation, this poem reminds us that all things end, all things decay; winter always comes, no matter how bountiful the harvest.</p>

<p>And yet something also always remains. The inhabitants of the ruins, like the author of the poem and the copyists of the manuscript, have vanished — but the ruins, the poem, the things themselves, they survive. There is loss, yes, but memory remains. An elegy can only exist if something is remembered, is valued enough to remember.</p>

<p>Change can feel like death, like loss. And I think it&rsquo;s obvious that western culture, especially after centuries of colonization and globalization, is changing. But all things end; this is the way of the world. We may mourn the end, elegize the great monuments of the past. But someday we too will be mourned and elegized by those who come after us.</p>

<p>This knowledge can free us from the need to preserve, from the need to prevent change. And as the seasons shift, let us take a moment to contemplate the transience of the world.</p>

<p>So far in this series on white supremacy and the middle ages, we&rsquo;ve established that medieval Europe was not <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">&ldquo;dark&rdquo;</a> but rather a vital <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">building block</a> of western culture — which means that we cannot simply abandon the period to white supremacists. Additionally, on <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-and-race">Monday</a> I sketched out the problems with the idea that the middle ages were racially homogenous, problems that relate both to the historical facts and to our projection of post-Enlightenment race onto the medieval period. Today, I conclude with one of the thornier events of the middle ages: the crusades.</p>

<p>Alt-right movements both in America and in Europe tend to be anti-Islam, using images and phrases (like <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-38353706">deus vult</a>) from the medieval crusades to underscore a commitment to protecting western culture from outside threats. The only problem with this is the fact that the medieval crusades weren&rsquo;t about protecting Europe from outside threats.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to start with a brief timeline of the rise of Islam and the crusades. Muhammad, whose visions in the early 7th century became the Qu'ran, founded a religious community that quickly united the tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Neither the Byzantine Empire to the north and west or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> to the east had ever had much interest in controlling the arid Arabian peninsula, so Muhammad and his successors filled a power vacuum in the area and quickly began to expand. In the first 150 years of Islam, Arabic tribes conquered across North Africa, into Europe in the Iberian peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal), to the east in the old Persian empire, and northward into the Byzantine empire.</p>

<p>As rapidly as the Arabic empire spread, it did not make it into western Europe beyond the Iberian peninsula and the island of Sicily. In the late eighth century, Umayyad incursions into modern-day France were decisively rebuffed by French rulers. After this point, Muslim rulers controlled most of the Iberian peninsula (which they named Al-Andalus) but no longer attempted to invade western Europe across the Pyrenees. And while the history of medieval Spain could be an entire post, it&rsquo;s worth noting that even as Christians reclaimed parts of Spain the Christian/Muslim divide was seldom clear or simplistic. Often Christian rulers warred against their Muslim neighbors, but just as often they allied with Muslim rulers to fight a common enemy — Christian or Muslim. In other words, the narrative of Muslim conquest and Christian resistance does not match the more complicated reality in medieval Spain.</p>

<p>The island of Sicily, off the toe of the boot of the Italian peninsula, was also controlled at least partially by Muslim rulers for about 250 years between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Because of its desirable position for trade across the Mediterranean, Sicily has been controlled by most of the key players in the region at one point or another; in the medieval period, it was held by the Goths, then the Byzantines, then Muslim rulers, then the Norman French before becoming a point of contention between the pope, the Holy Roman emperors, and Spanish rulers. In other words, Arabic rulers were one of a multitude of people groups who sought to control the island and its trade — and for Muslim rulers, Sicily was not a launching point for European invasion but a key shipping location in the busy commercial world of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In short, after the eighth century the Latin west — the old western part of the Roman empire — was not under serious threat of invasion and conquest by Arabic Muslims.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> However, the old eastern half of the Roman empire, now known as the Byzantine empire, saw a different situation. Because it bordered the Arabian peninsula and in the early middle ages controlled trade routes in what we call the Middle East, the Byzantine empire experienced frequent conflict with the expanding Arabic empire. Over the centuries of the middle ages, the Byzantine world contracted under the initial Arabic expansion, then expanded under two centuries of strong rulers, then contracted again, slowly, until it was overtaken by the Ottoman Turks in 1455.</p>

<p>So in the late eleventh century, on the eve of the crusades, it was the Byzantine empire rather than the Latin west that faced Arabic invaders. The Byzantine period of expansion and strong rulers had come to an end and, in the chaos, Arabic rulers attempted to expand into Byzantium.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Emissaries from Alexios I, the Byzantine emperor, came to pope Urban II in 1095 to ask for help defending the city of Constantinople. Urban II seized on this opportunity and, on November 27, 1095 he promulgated the first crusade in a <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html">famous speech.</a></p>

<p>However, Urban II and Alexios I had significantly different visions of what form western aid to the Byzantines should take. Alexios I wanted soldiers, who he would pay; the Byzantine armies like modern armies worked on a payment model. However, western European armies were feudal and land ownership was the foundation of wealth; soldiers were either rewarded with plunder from victories or, for the nobility, granted land for service. Cash payment would not appeal to the nobles who led the armies who fought for land. Alexios I would not have given his land to western European nobles. Urban II not only knew this, but was also deeply concerned about the violent squabbling between Christian rulers over arable land — most of which had been claimed by the late eleventh century.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Thus, rather than calling for volunteers to defend Constantinople as Alexios I had requested, Urban II called for soldiers to conquer the Holy Land. He thus addresses, in some way, the problem of Arabic incursions into Byzantium while also giving the nobility of Europe a new opportunity to gain territory without fighting against other Christians. It&rsquo;s certainly overly simplistic to see only mercenary reasons for the crusades, since the idea of regaining the Holy Land from the Muslims held significant emotional power as well. But under Urban II&rsquo;s vision of the crusades, most crusaders had a variety of motives for taking part: defeating Muslims, having knightly adventures, gaining land and treasure, earning a <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm">plenary indulgence</a> for sins.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that Urban II hoped to reunite the western church and the eastern church, which had diverged in language, theology and hierarchy as the Roman empire dissolved in the west but only formally split in 1054 CE, recent history for Urban II. However, despite the first hundred years of largely successful crusading, the crusades ended up deepening divisions between the Byzantine empire and the west. The fourth crusade (1202-4) never even reached the Holy Land; instead, after becoming embroiled in political unrest in Constantinople, the unpaid western armies grew restless and plundered the city.</p>

<p>All of which to say: while the initial impetus for the crusades is the request from Byzantium for aid against Muslim invaders, the crusades were only partially, if at all, about defending Europe from the Muslims. In fact, shifting the objective of the first crusade from helping Constantinople to retaking the Holy Land suggests that western rulers weren&rsquo;t particularly concerned about either the fate of Constantinople or keeping Byzantium as a buffer between western Europe and the Arabic empire. Were crusaders motived by the desire to defend Christendom against Muslims? Probably many were. But they also wanted to <em>reclaim</em> or <em>expand</em> Christendom, and few would have seem themselves or their kingdoms as directly threatened by Muslims.</p>

<p>Moreover, remember that identity categories in the middle ages, as I discussed on Monday, could be fluid, complicating European views of Islam. Most western Europeans identified as Christian, a powerful pan-European identity that also linked western and Byzantine Christians. One could not, obviously, identify as both a Christian and a Muslim, and there are plentiful works of art and literature that sharply contrast Christian and Muslim. The twelfth-century <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/roland-ohag.asp"><em>Song of Roland</em></a>, for example, presents Muslims as completely evil and worshipping an unholy trinity made up of Mohammed, a demon named Termagant, and the Roman god Apollo. And when king Arthur&rsquo;s rebellious nephew/incestuous son Mordred (very ahistorically) allies with Saracens (a medieval term for Muslims), this proves the depth of Mordred&rsquo;s wickedness.</p>

</figure></p>

<p>And yet, European scholars had great respect for Arabic scholarship, particularly medical scholarship and commentaries on Aristotle. The Muslim ruler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin">Saladin</a> was greatly admired by the leaders of the Third Crusade — especially England&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England">Richard I</a> — even as their armies battled. And in the fourteenth century, the English travel writer John Mandeville unfavorably compared Christian nobles to Muslims, who he claimed more closely adhered to the ideals of chivalry and morality in general despite their ignorance of Christianity. These examples show that, despite the large religious divide, scholarship and chivalry provided points of contact between the Christian and Muslim worlds.</p>

<p>My goal in today&rsquo;s post has been to sketch the often complex relationship between the kingdoms of western Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Muslim world. These relationships were not, with some notable exceptions, always peaceful and harmonious. And because religious and ethnic identities were tightly connected, it is accurate in some senses to see a conflict between Christianity and Islam. And yet the crusades also brought about closer contact between western Europe and the Arabic empire, contact that enriched European scholarship and bridged cultural divides.</p>

<p>It is not historically accurate to imagine medieval Europe as united against an encroaching Islamic threat, or as striving to preserve its cultural heritage in the face of outside invaders. This notion overstates a united European identity, exaggerates the threat posed by the Arabic empire, and ignores the peaceful and productive exchanges of scholarship and culture between the Christian west and Islamic east at various times during the middle ages.</p>

<p>The medieval period is not the best model for modern-day relationships between majority Muslim and majority Christian nations. But neither do the middle ages provide proof that Christianity and Islam are incompatible and must remain locked in combat until one or the other disappears.</p>

<p>There were periodic Arabic raids along the Mediterranean, including in Marseille and coastal cities in Italy.

            <title>Were the European Middle Ages Racially Homogenous?</title>

</figure></p>

<p>Last week, we began a series on white supremacy and the middle ages. I started with the notion that the middle ages were the dark ages (<a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2b">here</a>), since that idea makes it easy to abandon the middle ages to those who would use it to support their agenda of racial or cultural purity. As we discovered, however, the middle ages — far from being dark — play an important role in the development of western culture.</p>

<p>Last week&rsquo;s posts sketch how the middle ages, rather than being dark and ignorant, are instead a vital period in the development of western culture. But this is not a culture that leads inevitably to white supremacy. Today and Wednesday, I develop this argument along two lines: today, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the idea that Europe was racially homogenous in the middle ages; on Wednesday, I discuss the crusades and the idea that Europe was united in opposition to encroaching Islam.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s post on race is not going to be comprehensive, because I&rsquo;m not writing a book. I&rsquo;m including links at the bottom of the post for further reading on race and the middle ages for any who are interested — and I&rsquo;m going to plug the Tumblr <a href="http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com">People of Color in European Art History</a> up here as well, since the art curated there is worth thousands of words insisting that people of color did, in fact, exist in medieval Europe.</p>

<p>But before we turn to the middle ages, we need to start with the Enlightenment for a very specific reason: the eighteenth-century Enlightenment is when our modern notion of race emerged, and specifically the notion of whiteness against which all other races were measured (and found lacking). Human beings undoubtedly have noticed, categorized, and assigned value to differences throughout history, but cultures frame those differences in a variety of ways. Our modern framing of race, including our valuation of European whiteness as the standard from which other races diverge, comes not from biology or some vague feature of human nature or even ancient or medieval western culture, but from Enlightenment thinkers.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment scholars, as they studied the past, projected their ideas about race back onto the middle ages, constructing a purely white medieval Europe. And their legacy lingers: even today, and even among specialists who should know better, the focus is almost always on white figures. You can&rsquo;t get through a graduate degree with a medieval specialty without studying Thomas Aquinas or Dante — but you can (as I know from experience) get said degree without any study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">medieval Jewish thinkers</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Maurice">Saint Maurice</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes">Islamic scholars</a> of Sicily and Spain.</p>

<p>And this whitewashing of medieval history shows up even in pop culture representations — in the nearly all-white cast of <em>Game of Thrones,</em> for example, or the periodic grumbling about the BBC&rsquo;s colorblind casting policy in shows like <em>Merlin.</em> Or Tolkien&rsquo;s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a very medieval epic in which the only characters of color are barely-mentioned enemies of Gondor and the West.</p>

<p>Given both the contents of textbooks and the representations we see on screen, plus the assumption that the dark ages must have been ignorant and bigoted, it&rsquo;s no surprise that we assume that the middle ages were racially homogenous. But we should reexamine this assumption through two different lenses: first, the way that medieval people themselves thought about race; and second, the extent to which we can see homogeneity.</p>

<p>The first question is the most complex: how did medieval people think about race? The first thing to know is that Latin, the language of medieval scholarship, doesn&rsquo;t have a term that easily equates to what we mean by &ldquo;race&rdquo; today. Writers could use a few terms, such as <em>gens</em> — a word that can be most broadly translated &ldquo;people,&rdquo; but that can mean &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; or &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; with connotations of biological descent.</p>

<p>As Christians, however, medieval European thinkers emphasized common descent from Adam. They also saw the natural environment as an important factor in creating different appearances, which means that physical appearance isn&rsquo;t always tied to race or biological descent. For example, because they believed that extreme heat causes the skin to darken, medieval thinkers thought that an African who relocated to Europe would become lighter-skinned, or see lighter-skinned descendants (the opposite would also be true — fair-skinned Europeans would darken in equatorial climates). From our modern point of view, this significantly misunderstands genetics. But it&rsquo;s also crucial to understand that the physical markers of modern-day race, like skin tone, were not seen by medieval people as barriers to assimilation into other cultures or as indications of character or mental ability.</p>

<p>Additionally, customs, language, and law were viewed by medieval people as key markers of racial or ethnic identity —  social, not biological, factors. Different language groups, what we might call different racial or ethnic groups, frequently coexisted within larger political entities, such as the various princedoms of the Holy Roman Empire or the Welsh and Scots in England. This means that many medieval people would have had complex and overlapping racial and ethnic identities.</p>

<p>These medieval thoughts about race and ethnicity demonstrate that, in the middle ages, &ldquo;race&rdquo; meant something rather different than it does today. And importantly, the idea of racial purity would probably not have made sense to medieval thinkers, since for them race and ethnicity are shaped by natural and social environments — change those, and ethnic identity can also change. One example is the <a href="https://theconversation.com/vikings-were-never-the-pure-bred-master-race-white-supremacists-like-to-portray-84455">Viking</a> settlement of Normandy (in modern-day France). Viking invasions along the Seine turned into settlements, and over time the Viking settlers intermarried with the original inhabitants and adopted the French language and French customs. Neither the Vikings nor the French seem to have been particularly concerned about racial purity or mixed ethnicities, despite facing the inevitable tensions that can arise when two different people groups begin to live together.</p>

<p>So for medieval people, race or ethnicity depended in part on descent, in part on geography, and in part on language, law and customs — a rather more complex and flexible definition of race or ethnicity than what arose in the Enlightenment.</p>

<p>But despite this medieval understanding of race, weren&rsquo;t the vast majority of people in Europe at the time just white?</p>

<p>Hopefully the discussion above has shown that medieval people wouldn&rsquo;t have viewed everyone in Europe as a homogenous race, given a diversity of climates, languages, laws and customs. Some homogenizing factors did, however, exist in Europe. Christianity is the crucial cultural unifier, which I will discuss more on Wednesday with the crusades. For the nobility, the laws of chivalry provided a pan-European identity,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the cultural explosion of the twelfth century saw certain styles of art and manuscript production (which we now call Gothic) spread across Europe and supplant more localized styles. But while these factors provided points of contact among European people groups, they did not produce a unified European ethnic identity.</p>

<p>Moreover, Europe had non-white inhabitants. In the Roman period, the Roman custom was to distribute armies across the empire — so North Africans served in England, Gauls in the middle east, etc. As Roman power waned, some of these soldiers undoubtedly remained where they were stationed, becoming absorbed into the population.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Jewish settlements also existed in many cities across Europe, with Jewish people living and working alongside their Christian neighbors but holding distinct languages, laws and customs. Similarly, both Sicily and Spain had Muslim communities that often existed alongside Christian and Jewish communities.</p>

<p>Additionally, Europeans traded with the known world: the Silk Road took merchants to the far east, spices and fables of a Christian kingdom came from India, and artistic influence flowed between southern Europe and west Africa. Travelers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo">Marco Polo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mandeville">John Mandeville</a> entertained audiences with tales of their travels — real travels, although highly embellished narratives. In the realm of fiction, foreign knights served in Arthur&rsquo;s fabled court: like the Saracen (Arabic) knight Palomides, a paragon of chivalry who only converts to Christianity as he dies, or the African <a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/morien.html">Sir Morian</a>, hero of his own Dutch romance.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that medieval Europeans valued diversity in a modern sense; that also recreates medieval Europe into our own image. But to imagine Europe in the middle ages as racially homogenous requires us to both ignore evidence to the contrary and to project Enlightenment ideas about race onto medieval people. And while medieval people were certainly quite capable of bigotry, their ideas and experiences of race certainly do not support the notion that medieval Europe is a model for white supremacy or white nationalism.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re focusing this week on the idea of the middle ages as &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; because this common narrative, although lacking historical support, makes us inclined to believe that the middle ages were a period of ignorance, barbarism, superstition and bigotry. So when white supremacists use the middle ages to support their claims that western culture is white (and, often, Christian), popular ideas of the middle ages do nothing to combat this view. I&rsquo;ll turn next week to the specific arguments about cultural homogeneity and the crusades, but this week I am laying a foundation for understanding the middle ages as culturally vibrant and crucial in the development of western culture — but a western culture that does not inevitably support white supremacy.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-04-2017-middle-ages-part-2a">Wednesday,</a> I sketched out my first objection to the &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo; narrative, namely that Rome fell to uncivilized barbarians and everything was basically awful until the Renaissance, when light returned to Europe. Today I look at the other two aspects of the dark ages narrative, that Roman culture disappeared and that the middle ages produced little to nothing of value for western culture.</p>

<p>Although the continuation of Roman culture isn&rsquo;t obvious because of the popular narrative, it really should be obvious. Christianity, the official religion of Rome from the late fourth century onward, continued to be the dominant religion as the various people groups in Europe converted (some more and some less voluntarily) to Christianity. Latin continued to be spoken, although without the standardizing influence of imperial structures it gradually diverged into what we call romance languages — French, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, etc. But as the vernacular (commonly spoken) dialects diverged, Latin remained the standard language of communication across Europe for both the Church and scholarship more broadly.</p>

<p>Roman authors were preserved and studied; educated people from the early to the late middle ages would have been familiar with Ovid, Virgil, Cicero, and a whole host of Roman writers — not to mention the Latin church fathers like Jerome and Augustine.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to discount cultural change, or the impact of the power shifts as the Roman empire disintegrated. The period from the late fifth century through the eighth centuries was marked by invasions and shifting political alliances accompanied by the deterioration of Roman infrastructure (primarily roads and trade routes). The meant less trade and economic prosperity, and as the influence of Rome decreased Germanic customs and laws became more prominent (we can still see their influence in English and American law, in things like juries).</p>

<p>But even as they were aware of their Germanic heritage, most rulers in medieval Europe admired Rome and viewed it as also part of their heritage. Just one example will make my point: the emperor Charlemagne. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 800 CE. The joke goes that the political entity called the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire — and there&rsquo;s some truth in that. But Charlemagne aspired to rule in the style of Rome, and he reopened trade routes, communicated with the Byzantine emperor, and sponsored schools and scholars in what researchers today call the Carolingian renaissance. It&rsquo;s easy to see from our vantage point the differences between Charlemagne&rsquo;s kingdom and the Roman empire. But his desire to emulate the Roman emperors of old should tell us that Rome continued to have an effect on medieval culture.</p>

<p>So why the idea that culture was lost? First, there&rsquo;s that barbarian narrative, promoted by Roman writers during the empire and by historians of Rome since the Italian renaissance. Barbarians are the opposite of cultured — in fact, they smash culture. But this ignores reality, as I discuss above, and ignores the fact that these &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; also had a culture that may have been different from Roman culture but was not inferior. And as with other cultural absorptions before this (as when the Romans emulated Greek culture), western culture became a blend of Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian, and Germanic cultures.</p>

<p>But the grain of truth in the &ldquo;lost culture&rdquo; is the loss of Greek in the medieval west. Some scholars in the middle ages almost certainly learned Greek (<a href="%20https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/">Peter Abelard</a> and possible even <a href="%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lo%C3%AFse">Heloise</a> are examples), but they were a distinct minority. Because very few works by prominent Greek thinkers had been translated into Latin, with the exception of Plato, much Greek philosophy and literature vanished from western Europe until the twelfth century renaissance, when the works of Aristotle were translated into Latin (via Arabic scholarship) and the medieval academic world was transformed.</p>

<p>The scholars of the Italian renaissance, beginning in the fourteenth century, rediscovered more and more Greek texts and began to actually learn Greek, unlike most university scholars of the twelfth century. This does, once again, change the academy with new ideas; but it&rsquo;s a vast overstatement to imagine that this is a rediscovery of western culture. It&rsquo;s a rediscovery of some aspects of Greek culture and a shift in how those sources are studied — even if the Italian humanists paint themselves in a far more radical light.</p>

<p>Finally — and I imagine that I&rsquo;ve partially made this point already — the middle ages were a culturally rich period. The idea that historians have few records would be laughable it it weren&rsquo;t so common. True, there are certain periods and places where historical records are fragmentary; invasions in the fifth through seventh centuries by Germanic tribes and, later, Arabic groups disrupt or destroy records, as do the ninth and tenth century invasions by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magyar_tribes">Magyars</a> and Vikings. And obviously, cultural productions (art, literature, scholarship) are difficult during periods when people are focused on simple survival.</p>

<p>But the cultural accomplishments of the middle ages are substantial. Medieval buildings still dot the European landscape. Medieval authors, like Chaucer and Dante, shaped the course of western literature by writing in vernacular languages rather than Latin. Medieval artists and artisans pioneered stained glass and built soaring cathedrals that we still admire. Many of the great universities of Europe — Oxford, Paris, Bologna — were all established in the high middle ages. Scholasticism grappled with how to integrate theology and philosophy, faith and reason, in ways that still shape our approaches to those topics. <a href="http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/staley-book-of-margery-kempe-introduction">Margery Kempe</a>, in England, wrote what many consider the first autobiography, while French and English writers pioneered the prose narratives that became the modern novel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system#History">Double entry bookkeeping</a> was invented in medieval Italy while Italian city-states like Florence embraced republican forms of government. The nation-state itself as a political entity emerged in the late middle ages.</p>

<p>I could go on, but you get the picture.</p>

<p>Was there oppression and injustice in medieval Europe? Certainly. There were also odd notions about bathing, and medical care — while based on Greek and Roman ideas — was not particularly effective.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> As in most of the ancient world, illiterate peasants<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> made up the vast majority of the population while a small cadre of nobles held the wealth and power.</p>

<p>But to dismiss the middle ages as the dark ages, a time of ignorance and barbarity, is to ignore a vast swath of time and its equally vast influence on the development of western culture.</p>

<p>If we can&rsquo;t simply dismiss the middle ages as ignorant and backwards, then we also can&rsquo;t abandon it to those who would twist history to support white supremacy. And in parts three and four of this series, I will turn to two main arguments for white supremacy in the middle ages and examine why they are wrong.</p>

<p>Welcome to part 2 of my series on the middle ages and why they matter!  As Christians who oppose white supremacy we should take seriously the attempt by white supremacists to frame the middle ages as a racially homogenous (white) Christian utopia. Imagining the past in this way allows white supremacists to believe that western culture (or, more precisely, white culture) is under siege by (take your pick) multiculturalism, feminism, Islam, or political correctness. I introduced this idea in <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/10/10-02-2017-middle-ages-introduction">part 1</a>; in part 3 I will look more closely at the claim that Europe was racially homogenous, and in part 4 I will turn to the Crusades.</p>

<p>For part 2, I&rsquo;m starting with the characterization of the medieval period in Europe (roughly 500 - 1500 CE) as the &ldquo;dark ages.&rdquo; This misconception about the middle ages allows us to ignore it. We&rsquo;re predisposed to believe that medieval people were ignorant and racist, so even if we reject the <em>purpose</em> of the white supremacist argument (to elevate whiteness), popular understandings of the middle ages give us no reason to dispute the <em>data</em> behind the claims.</p>

<p>I want to make a case for disputing the data, so we can not only reject the conclusions of white supremacy but also its facts. So we&rsquo;re starting with the idea that the middle ages were the Dark Ages. I cringe just typing the phrase, but you know the narrative: Rome was awesome and cultured (or, at least, powerful). Then stinking, uncivilized barbarians invaded and destroyed. The End. Dark ages for a millennium until the scholars of the Italian Renaissance rediscovered truth and beauty and science and all that. (And, bonus for Protestants, the Reformers simultaneously &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; Christianity.)</p>

<p>This narrative crops up everywhere, even amongst the most educated people. For example, an otherwise solid book published in 2017 (I reviewed it <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/resources/review/book-review-gender-roles-and-people-god">here</a>), says this about the middle ages:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rome&rsquo;s days were numbered, and by the end of the fifth century, the Ostrogothic Kingdom rose from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire. The thousand-year "Dark Ages&rdquo; had begun, so called because historians have few records from that long period in which much of the earlier culture was lost. In its heyday, the Roman Empire had provided widespread literacy, law, historical records, and an international language of science and literature. But invading barbaric tribes had no interest in preserving much of Roman culture.&ldquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>This nonsense was written by a scholar with advanced degrees and passed through the editing process at a reputable publisher, showing how deeply ingrained this narrative is.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to break this quote down and address three specific misconceptions that undergird the idea of the &ldquo;dark ages&rdquo;: first, that Rome experienced some sort of dramatic fall; second, that Roman (and thus western) culture was lost; and third, that we have few records (historical or otherwise) from this period.</p>

<p>First, the fall of Rome. It&rsquo;s common knowledge that Rome fell to invading barbarian tribes.</p>

<p>But the reality is not anywhere near so simple, even though it is a fact that from 476 CE onward (with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I">brief exception</a>), the western portion of the Roman empire was no longer ruled by people who were ethnically Roman. That &ldquo;ethnically Roman&rdquo; is key, as is the division between eastern and western halves of the empire.</p>

<p>In 293 CE, the emperor Diocletian instituted a tetrarchy, a system of four rulers in the Roman empire. Although his tetrarchy didn&rsquo;t last for long, this system recognized the deep-seated cultural, linguistic and economic divisions between the eastern and western halves of the empire, and a two-emperor system became the new normal. Two hundred years later, Gothic leaders sought to rule in the west, but not the east; and the eastern Roman Empire continued to thrive — as what we call the Byzantine Empire — until 1455.</p>

<p>The Gothic rulers of Rome came, of course, from Germanic tribes, but by the time they ruled Rome in the fifth century they were quite Romanized. They were Christians, they used Latin, they served in Rome&rsquo;s armies as soldiers and generals, they held titles bestowed by the eastern emperor and the Roman Senate. This Romanization of some Gothic tribes began in the fourth century, when several Germanic tribes had been given land and partially incorporated into the Roman Empire in order to defend the empire against other tribes.</p>

<p>Rome, however, treated these tribes (called federated tribes) very poorly, giving them land that couldn&rsquo;t be farmed and withholding promised rights. This understandably angered many Germanic leaders — but they also understood that the Roman army was an excellent way to advance in power and influence. Alaric, the Visigoth who sacked Rome in 410, was a Roman general. Odoacer, the Ostrogoth who took control of the city of Rome in 476 (the date traditionally assigned to the Fall of Rome), was also a Roman soldier who enjoyed the support of the Roman senate and who, in theory at least, placed himself under the authority of the emperor in the east.</p>

<p>But by the time that these Gothic rulers took control of the western part of the empire, Roman control in western Europe had already diminished significantly. Roman armies had conquered large swaths of Europe, building roads and aqueducts and towns for soldiers and bureaucrats, but the expense of maintaining the infrastructure of empire far outweighed the income that came from these western territories. From the mid-third century on, Rome had struggled to maintain the poorer western half of the empire as its center of power shifted eastward. So the Gothic kings styled themselves as Romans in many ways, but their power, like the power of the Roman rulers they replaced, certainly never equalled the power of the emperors during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana"><em>Pax Romana</em></a> (which ended in the late second century).</p>

<p>Additionally, while many Gothic tribes were Romanized, their rulers tended to think in terms of kin groups rather than empires. Thus the power of the Roman rulers gradually diminished to the Italian peninsula itself while other Germanic groups — some Romanized, some not — ruled in various parts of Europe in the early middle ages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve very briefly sketched complex history, but it should be clear that the reports of Rome&rsquo;s death are greatly exaggerated. The Roman empire in the west gradually diminished for economic and political reasons for at least a century before the event we call the fall of Rome in 476 CE. Moreover, the Gothic rulers who took over the western part of the empire were Romanized, as their interest in gaining the support of the Roman Senate and the blessings of the eastern emperor shows. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that things stayed the same; the western empire slowly dissolved as a political entity. But the barbarian hordes narrative certainly doesn&rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a long time on this first point about the fall of Rome because it&rsquo;s necessary for the second point: that Roman culture did not disappear. I&rsquo;ll turn to my other two points, that Roman culture continued and that the middle ages are a rich source of history and culture, on Friday.</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about how the culture war is concerned, at least in part, with defending and defining western culture. The &ldquo;defining&rdquo; piece is crucial: western culture has been around for at least 2500 years, and that&rsquo;s if we only start with the Greeks (the Golden Age of Athens began in roughly 480 BCE). Western culture has also spread geographically from a small section of the Mediterranean (again, if we discount the earlier Fertile Crescent cultures) to dominate two continents and influence most of the rest of the globe.</p>

<p>Obviously, something that old and that spread out contains multitudes.</p>

<p>In order to make this history more manageable, most people intentionally or not focus on western history post-Renaissance or post-Enlightenment. (That is, western history after 1500 or 1700 CE.) Scholars designate this the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; period, and this is an age of rationalism, science and technology, individualism, capitalism, colonialism, and democracy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also distressingly common for people — laypeople and scholars alike — to accept the assertions of Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers that they emerged from a previous period of darkness and chaos. &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; means rebirth; &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; emphasizes the light (of reason) triumphing over darkness.</p>

<p>These are inspiring narratives, no doubt, and they fit neatly into our own current sense of being the best, the most advanced, the most intelligent society in the history of earth. But in addition to a wee bit of hubris, these claims actually obscure a far richer and more complex understanding of western culture.</p>

<p>So, why does this matter? Why should a modern-day Christian living in the western world care about understanding the past?</p>

<p>There are a lot of possible answers to that question. If we don&rsquo;t understand the past, we are doomed to repeat it. Or, understanding the past makes us better, well-rounded people. Or, understanding the past gives us new perspectives on the problems of modern life.</p>

<p>All of these are true, at least in part (although I have Things To Say about the &ldquo;doomed to repeat the past&rdquo; bit). But there&rsquo;s a more pressing reason to understand the pre-Enlightenment, pre-Renaissance past these days, and that&rsquo;s thanks to the growing visibility of white supremacy.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.inthemedievalmiddle.com/2017/08/teaching-medieval-studies-in-time-of.html?m=1">many</a> <a href="https://psmag.com/education/nazis-love-taylor-swift-and-also-the-crusades">medievalists</a> (scholars of the middle ages) have recently pointed out, those of us with expertise in the field need to do a better job of explaining how the medieval past does not support white supremacy. If we as Christians also want to reject white supremacy, it&rsquo;s worth understanding and resisting how this movement twists medieval history.</p>

<p>And as Christians, this task is <em>especially</em> important because the way that white supremacists frame the middle ages is often as an era of the church militant and triumphant: it&rsquo;s not a coincidence that pictures of the rally in Charlottesville this August show men with medieval shields and crusader crosses, often paired with the Latin phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_vult"><em>deus vult</em></a> — a crusading slogan.</p>

<p>If we care about racism, history, or Christianity, we should care about understanding the medieval past and the role of the church in that past.</p>

<p>(Note: for simplicity, I will use &ldquo;middle ages&rdquo; and &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; to refer to the European middle ages. But the world didn&rsquo;t contract to Europe in this period: a variety of cultures flourished in the far east, the middle east, the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and the Americas — and Europe had contact with many of them. Focusing only on Europe is, of course, one way in which the primacy of western culture is reinforced. But my own expertise is in the European middle ages, and this is the specific era that is being twisted to support white nationalism.)</p>

<p>Over the next two weeks, I will examine a couple of specific misconceptions about the middle ages that fuel the myths of white supremacy:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The middle ages were the Dark Ages and Everything was Awful All. The. Time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Europe was racially homogenous.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The crusades were about defending Europe from Islam.</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>I hope that, through the next several posts, I can show that the history and culture of the middle ages in Europe cannot be used a support for white supremacy. I want to replace the myth of racial, cultural and religious homogeneity with a more complex picture of medieval history.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to be completely honest here: I love the middle ages. I find them fascinating on so many levels: the theological debates, the literary innovations, the emergence of the nation-state, the art, the manuscripts. Basically everything. I&rsquo;ve also spent the last fifteen or so years of my life studying this period and helping my students to understand it.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a little passionate.</p>

<p>Like all other time periods (and maybe more so, since the medieval period spans roughly a thousand years), there are good and bad parts. And I&rsquo;m certainly not interested in the slightest in giving up my voting rights, sweat-wicking fabrics, antibiotics or Netflix. All of which to say: I&rsquo;m not interested in glorifying chivalry or monarchy, or sugar-coating the really sucky aspects of living in the middle ages.</p>

<p>But this is also part of our history, and as we think about what it might mean to move beyond modernism, understanding the pre-modern past can be instructive. And now, more than ever, we must assert and affirm that western culture does not inevitably lead to white supremacy (although it has produced plenty of white supremacists).</p>

<p>Come with me over the next two weeks to learn a little more about the strange and wonderful world of the middle ages as we reclaim the history of Europe.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Apocalyptic Fiction</title>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of science fiction and fantasy — have been since my dad started reading me <em>The Hobbit</em> when I was six or seven. Early exposure to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis likely predisposed me to medieval studies and set up a lifelong skepticism of realistic fiction.</p>

<p>While I enjoy SF/F of all types, I&rsquo;m always particularly intrigued by how writers integrate faith into their worlds. Charlie Stross&rsquo;s series <em>The Laundry Files</em> doesn&rsquo;t portray faith (especially of the American evangelical variety) particularly positively. But the series focuses on a coming apocalypse in which Lovecraftian horrors from beyond our universe will crash into our reality and devour us all, and I find this vision of the coming apocalypse both horrifying and compelling — the mark of enjoyable fiction.</p>

<p>I confess that apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction always piques my interest. Maybe it comes of having been raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism">dispensationalist</a> — you can take the girl out of the pre-trib rapture, but you can&rsquo;t take the four horsemen of the apocalypse out of the girl (as they say).</p>

<p>Stross&rsquo;s novels mostly follow Bob Howard, programmer and British civil servant, as he attempts to avert apocalyptic events. The series was described to me as James Bond meets Cthulhu, but only if James Bond is a nerd who constantly ends up way over his head and who actually, like, respects women (although he still has cool gadgets). Oh, and Bob works for a shadowy British agency dedicated to helping humanity survive <strong><em>Code Nightmare Green</em></strong>, a rapidly approaching time when our reality will coincide with the reality of those Lovecraftian horrors who will most likely find humanity an appetizing snack.</p>

<p><figure class="float-left">

<p></figure></p>

<p>Stross does a fantastic job of capturing the pure horror of the vastly powerful non-human entities that are just waiting for a chance to come to earth and consume it. One such entity is simply called the Sleeper: this being is currently trapped in an a pyramid on a dead planet guarded by zombie Russian soldiers, in a bizarre scene custom-designed to produce nightmares.</p>

<p>In <em>The Apocalypse Codex</em>, the fourth book in the series, an American religious group led by the charismatic Ray Schiller seeks to wake the Sleeper. It seems that Schiller truly believes that the Sleeper is Christ and that he, by infecting people with parasitic hosts, is bringing about the Second Coming. Stross does present this cult as a perversion of more normal manifestations of Christianity (i.e., he doesn&rsquo;t suggest that the eucharist actually allows mind-controlling parasites into the bodies of partakers). But by linking the coming Lovecraftian horrors to apocalyptic Christian beliefs, Stross raises an interesting question about the nature of the apocalypse.</p>

<p>As Christians, we typically view the Second Coming of Christ (with or without a rapture or a millennial kingdom) as a good thing, although there may be a few unpleasant moments with beasts and Babylonian women of questionable morals. As N.T. Wright has noted in <em>Surprised by Hope</em>, Christians are often muddled about what life after death or the return of Christ means — but we do tend to agree that it will ultimately be a good thing for at least some of humanity (typically including us, of course).</p>

<p><figure class="float-right">

<p></figure></p>

<p>But think about this from another point of view: the second coming is <em>apocalyptic</em>. Even if we believe, with Wright, that Christ is returning not to annihilate but to to make new, the world will be completely changed. We believe that this change will be for the better, bringing peace and justice and God&rsquo;s good kingdom come on earth. Yet we&rsquo;re still imagining an alien entity coming down and remaking the entire world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that we need to start imagining God as one of Lovecraft&rsquo;s Great Old Ones, inimical to humanity. But we tend to imagine that God&rsquo;s kingdom will conform to our own ideas of happiness and goodness, whether that&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_House_(song)">mansions and football</a>, angels with harps on clouds, or peace on earth and the total eradication of mosquitoes (not just me, right?).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the return of Christ, the establishment of his kingdom on earth, will be a cataclysmic event that upturns the entire order of the created world. This is cause for rejoicing, as all that is wrong is made right again. But it&rsquo;s also a transformation beyond our wildest imaginings. As C.S. Lewis reminds us, our God is good, but he is not safe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy to avoid the apocalypse as envisioned by Stross, even if I enjoy stories about British agents battling unspeakable horrors from beyond our universe. But it&rsquo;s worth remembering, now and again, that the transformation we await as Christians will be bigger than we can possibly understand.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Culture War Addendum</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

</figure></p>

<p>I want to make a brief addendum to my two culture war posts last week (<a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-18-2017-culture-war-I">here</a> and <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-20-2017-culture-war-II">here</a> if you missed them). In those posts, I looked at how the culture war mentality creates a dichotomy between culture and church that prevents the church from either engaging productively with or acknowledging its dependence on culture.</p>

<p>But today I want to sketch a deeper background to the culture wars. I want to look at the nostalgia, and specifically the nostalgia for a particular version of western culture, that underlies the culture war ideology.</p>

<p>This may seem initially counter-intuitive: isn&rsquo;t the culture war a fight <em>against</em> culture? In some ways, yes; but it&rsquo;s also a fight against how, in the view of some, modern culture has shifted away from the values of traditional western society.</p>

<p>From this point of view, the culture wars aren&rsquo;t about church against culture at all, but about who gets to define and shape (western) culture — with a vision of culture rooted in the (nostalgically imagined) past.</p>

<p>This becomes evident when we consider what the culture wars <em>don&rsquo;t</em> normally attack or even criticize: democracy. Capitalism. Individualism. Rationalism. These are the values of post-Enlightenment western culture, but they certainly aren&rsquo;t expressly biblical values.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This defense of western culture has two broad results. First, it is the precondition that makes self-examination so difficult for the church. The culture war isn&rsquo;t particularly interested in interrogating the church&rsquo;s relationship to democracy, capitalism, rationalism or individualism, because those are viewed as western values almost equivalent to Christianity itself.</p>

<p>Second, it reinforces the elevation of western culture as the greatest culture. Because Christianity largely developed within western culture, the two become more or less synonymous. And if Christianity is the greatest religion, western culture must (to follow the logic) be the greatest culture.</p>

<p>These are all broad claims that deserve to be teased out in greater detail. But my point here is that the evangelical culture war meshes easily with a slightly different version of the culture war: not an explicitly evangelical or Christian one, but a war to defend western culture against perceived threats (such as multiculturalism, political correctness, feminism — insert a bogeyman <em>du jour</em>).</p>

<p>For the record, I understand why it is difficult to disentangle Christianity from western culture; after all, for the centuries from Constantine onward Christianity has had a significant influence on western culture. And as Christianity becomes a less dominant social force, a sense of crisis and nostalgia is understandable.</p>

<p>But we must be careful that our faithfulness to Christianity is not confused with faithfulness to western culture. Christianity has and will continue to thrive in a variety of cultures, and no culture ever fully aligns with the values of Christianity.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>Capitalism didn&rsquo;t exist for the writers of the Old or New Testament. In first-century Rome, democracy was a failed Greek experiment that was rejected by Plato and Aristotle themselves. While western culture has always valued rational thought, Enlightenment rationalism elevates this approach above all other ways of understanding the world. Similarly with individualism: western culture sees pendulum swings between individual and communal focuses, but the Enlightenment elevates the individual.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<blockquote><p><em>The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.</em>
<em>— Alexander Solzhenitsyn</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Fair warning: here be spoilers</em></p>

<p>Watching <em>Wonder Woman</em> on video last week, for a second time, I was struck by the way the storyline handles the idea of sin and evil in the world. I was also struck by how, even as she grapples with the evil within humanity, Diana chooses to love humanity in a way that reflects Christ.</p>

<p>Of course, having a superhero be a Christ-figure is so common as to be a cliché. Many male superheroes, in at least some of their storylines, fit this trope: Superman (obvs), Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man in <em>The Avengers</em>. Even the B-cast characters can be Christ-figures, like Agent Phil Coulson (<em>The Avengers</em>, <em>Agents of Shield</em>). These characters all sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, and — spoiler alert — none of them stay dead after their sacrifice (if they even die at all).</p>

<p>But Diana isn’t this sort of Christ-figure. She does leave her paradise of a home, and she certainly puts herself in danger for others — but at least in this summer’s film, she does not sacrifice herself for the sake of others. Instead, she chooses to live with humanity, loving them despite their flaws.</p>

<p>As the film sets up this choice, we see that at first Diana’s decision to help humanity is easy. She has been taught that Zeus created humans in his own image; as her mother tells her, mankind is “fair and good, strong and passionate.” But they become corrupted by Ares, god of war, envious of his father’s creation. Despite the intervention of the Amazons, humans remained corrupted, and eventually a war broke out between Ares and the other gods.</p>

<p>When Diana learns that World War I is raging — the Great War, the War to End All Wars — she is convinced that Ares is responsible. She leaves Themyscira, convinced that she can end the war by killing Ares. But what she discovers is more complicated. Ares is involved, yes (this is, after all, a superhero movie). But humans are not simply innocents, corrupted by another. They are fully complicit in the evil that is war.</p>

<p>The film shows the evil of humanity repeatedly. The unwillingness of leaders to seek peace. The stream of wounded humanity as Steve and Diana cross into Europe. The broken spirit of Charlie. The devastation of no man’s land, reflected in bodies, villages and landscapes. The acknowledgment that even though the Americans are fighting against oppression in this war, they conquered and oppressed native populations.</p>

<p>But Diana does not truly face this evil until, when she thinks she has killed Ares, she is shocked that the soldiers continue their destructive work, oblivious to her fight with General Ludendorff. She is experiencing what Ares later confirms: he may give some well-placed nudges towards evil, but humans are capable of great evil on their own.</p>

<p>This realization devastates Diana. Her view of humanity — “fair and good,” in the words of her mother’s bedtime story — is shattered.</p>

<p>But even as she turns to leave, newly aware of the truth in her mother’s parting words that humanity does not deserve her, she sees her companions willing to sacrifice themselves in order to save others. She sees Steve Trevor’s ultimate act of bravery and selflessness.</p>

<p>Diana faces the truth of the Solzhenitsyn quote above: humanity is both evil and good. And rather than abandon humanity in disdain of the evil, she chooses to stay out of love for the good.</p>

<p>Now, the analogy to Christ isn’t perfect. Unlike Diana, Jesus was fully aware of humanity’s sinfulness when he became incarnate. But like Christ, Diana also lives amongst humanity, serving and saving, because of her love for them. She leaves her home on Paradise Island and her place as the daughter of the queen because she believes that people, regardless of their evil nature, deserve a hero, deserve a savior.</p>

<p>This isn’t a side of the Christ-trope that we often see, at least in blockbuster films. When the hero dies, or nearly dies, for others, the focus typically remains on the hero. Sure, we get shots of grateful New Yorkers, but the hero’s bravery is the central point. Diana’s choice isn’t so much bravery as commitment, and the focus shifts from her actions to her reasons for the action, to her love for undeserving humanity.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Woman</em> tells Diana’s origin story. We see this as she learns who she is (the god-killer) and as she embraces her power in the fabulous no-man’s land scene. But the story behind the story is signaled by the photograph she receives as the film begins: the story of how she came to love humanity, the tale of why she chose to stay.</p>

<p>This origin story reminds us of the evil of humanity, of our sin nature. But it also reminds us of the lavish love of Christ, who lived among us despite the evil within each us and who never tells us that we don’t deserve him.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Idolizing Success: Wheaton Football Edition</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<figcaption>Blanchard Hall, Wheaton College | © 2010 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/43943756@N07">Teemu008</a> | via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blanchard_Hall_(5978664560).jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a> | <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en">CC-BY 2.5</a></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p><em>Note: I&rsquo;m assuming that the charges brought against the five accused players are largely true, especially given that Wheaton did apparently take some disciplinary action. Perhaps there are details that will justify allowing these players to remain on the team following the incident — but given the propensity of both sports teams and Christian organizations to downplay wrongdoing in order to protect their own reputation, I am skeptical that Wheaton&rsquo;s approach was sufficient given the magnitude of the hazing. As an alum, I truly hope that this incident is isolated and that it reminds the college that there are greater things than winning football games.</em></p>

<p>I was going to end this week on a lighter note, with a piece on sin and <em>Wonder Woman</em> (well, somewhat lighter … ). But then <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-wheaton-college-football-hazing-met-20170918-story.html">news broke</a> about five Wheaton College football players charged with felonies after a hazing incident that took place a year ago. Wheaton is my alma mater, and I&rsquo;m appalled at the details of this incident.</p>

<p>But even more appalling is the fact that all five football players who are accused of assaulting their first-year teammate were still on the team roster as of early this week. According to the Chicago <em>Tribune</em>, Wheaton did hire a third-party investigator and took &ldquo;corrective action,&rdquo; which may have only amounted to community service and an 8-page essay.</p>

<p>Let that sink in: community service and an <em>essay</em> for actions that are resulting in felony charges. (And while the five players have only been charged, not convicted, the fact that Wheaton imposed some disciplinary action indicates to me that the charges have merit.)</p>

<p>A Wheaton spokesperson noted that the actions of these football players are inconsistent with the values of Wheaton, and as an alum I wholeheartedly agree. But if these actions are so far removed from Wheaton&rsquo;s values, why did the players face such minimal consequences? Why were they still allowed on the team?</p>

<p>Alan Jacobs, a former Wheaton and current Baylor professor (who thus knows something about football scandals), <a href="http://blog.ayjay.org/15988/">noted astutely</a> that &ldquo;Collegiate Football Success is the most jealous of gods. It will tolerate the worship of no other deities, and there will be no end to the sacrifices it demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think Jacobs is absolutely right. Even those of us with little interest in sports (like me) cannot help but be aware of the repeated scandals that plague both college and professional athletics. The need to win excuses, and sometimes encourages, bad behavior on the part of players ranging from cheating (on the field or in the classroom) to domestic violence.</p>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t follow Wheaton football, I have no idea if the five accused players were any good — but I imagine that losing five at a time (plus, of course, the assaulted student who left after the incident) would jeopardize Wheaton&rsquo;s chances of a strong season.</p>

<p>I also imagine that the coaches, administrative staff, and trustees involved in this incident thought that they were right to give the players a second chance. The reasoning is familiar: boys will be boys, college students make dumb decisions, why should one bad choice ruin someone&rsquo;s collegiate sports experience?</p>

<p>But framing this as a learning opportunity — as the community service and essay seem to indicate — downplays the gravity of the students' actions. It also obscures the fact that the team itself (and its winning record) is what ultimately benefits from such minimal consequences.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to a culture in which winning is the ultimate good, and this is a culture that allows evil to thrive. I&rsquo;m sure that some of the football players were disgusted by their teammates' actions, and I hope that the five accused students understand that their actions went far beyond light-hearted hazing (if such a thing exists).</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m also sure that some on the team were emboldened by the lack of consequences. After all, if you can kidnap a teammate, threaten him with sexual assault, and leave him blindfolded and injured in a strange location at night without losing your place on the team, what else can you get away with?</p>

<p>Wheaton&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;for Christ and his kingdom.&rdquo; Sometimes you can serve Christ and win football games, but sometimes you can&rsquo;t. I hope that this incident reminds Wheaton not to bow to the false god of success in college football, but to remain true to Christ and his kingdom in the type of team spirit that they cultivate and in their willingness to confront sin in their midst.</p>]]></description>

<p>In <a href="http://www.intoresurrection.com/2017/09/09-18-2017-culture-war-I">part I</a>, I argued that in order to move beyond the culture war, we as a church need to firmly root our identity in Christ, rather than in some sort of moral exclusivity or, worse, in an opposition to culture. But what, exactly, does this mean? At the end of Monday&rsquo;s post, I suggested that the benefit of identifying primarily as a Christian is the gap it creates between us and our surrounding culture, a gap that allows for meaningful critique and engagement.</p>

<p>Now, to be clear, I&rsquo;m enough of a postmodernist to be deeply skeptical of any claim of objectivity. I&rsquo;m certainly not claiming that Christians can fully separate themselves from their broader culture; we are deeply implicated in our culture, for both better and worse. Indeed, one of the shortcomings of the culture war mentality is that it often focuses on a few areas of opposition without more carefully examining our immersion in the assumptions and values of western culture.</p>

<p>Once again, the Nashville Statement provides a prime example of the way the evangelical culture wars can focus on small constellation of issues without addressing our broader complicity in oppressive power structures. The statement itself insists that faithful Christians cannot even allow other Christians to so much as identify as gay — a position that even <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/flight-93-nashville-statement/">conservative evangelicals</a> find too strong.</p>

<p>And yet a number of the signers of the statement both endorsed and continue to support Donald Trump, despite his staggering and continued disrespect for women. Trump embodies the sinful sexism and misogyny that permeates American culture, and yet he gets a pass as a &ldquo;baby Christian&rdquo; that actual faithful Christians don&rsquo;t. This is, of course, hypocrisy of the highest order. But it also illustrates the way that the culture wars obscure the ways in which the church is complicit with the powers of evil and injustice in the world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the Nashville Statement as a recent example, but it&rsquo;s a single illustration of a broader problem rather than a unique instance. And to make the point once again, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to extract ourselves from our cultural context. But if our primary allegiance is to the kingdom of God, we need to think carefully about how our cultural assumptions and values conflict or mesh with the values of Christ&rsquo;s coming kingdom.</p>

<p>Because modern western culture has been shaped, in many ways, by Judeo-Christian values, because even non-western societies exhibit what theologians have called &ldquo;natural law,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and because I believe that the line between good and evil runs through all of us, no culture is going to be wholly evil. But because evil is present in the world, and the church is in the world, the church will be implicated in evil.</p>

<p>Our job is to carefully sift between the two, identifying the good in our cultures and the evil in our midst. We should also, of course, do the opposite — but it&rsquo;s seductively easy to point to the evil outside and the good inside. How can we speak prophetically to our culture, identifying the evils that cause harm and suffering, if we refuse to examine ourselves for those very evils?</p>

<p>This is abstract, but one specific example is sexism. Now, most Christians (there are exceptions) would agree that the sort of sexism that sees women as inherently less than men is wrong. But in myriad ways the church — both evangelical and mainstream — is terrible at actually encouraging women to be full participants in the life of the church.</p>

<p>As a more progressive Christian, it&rsquo;s easy to point my finger at complementarian churches that actively discourage women from using their gifts of teaching and leadership, or at least using those fully. But across denominations — including mainstream ones — only 10% of senior pastors are women. This means that even churches that theoretically affirm the full participation of women often do a poor job of addressing the underlying sexism that prevents women from reaching leadership positions.</p>

<p>And if we don&rsquo;t have the will to address sexism in our midst because doing so reveals assumptions and attitudes that make us uncomfortable, how can we speak to the oppression of women outside the church? Additionally, addressing sexism in the church means that we need to listen to feminist thinkers — many, if not most, of whom are now outside the church. But their insights are vital to understanding how we participate in and reinforce sexism, and how we can begin to end the oppression of patriarchy. And in the absence of a robust critique of sexism from within the church, we must partner with those outside it who also seek to end the oppression of patriarchy.</p>

<p>When we commit to modeling ourselves and our churches on Jesus, we put ourselves at an angle to our culture. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean war; rather, it places us in a unique position to speak to the evils of oppression and injustice. Existing at an angle to culture, however, does not mean that we are removed from it. So in order to maintain our witness, we must acknowledge the ways in which we participate in the evils of the world and be willing to amplify those outside the church who are also working against the powers of evil in the world.</p>

<p>In reading and writing about last month’s Nashville Statement, I’ve been thinking more broadly about the idea of a culture war. That statement is certainly another salvo in the ongoing conflict between the evangelical church and American culture, but like many other former or disaffected evangelicals I’m weary of the so-called culture wars. In my experience, this conflict isn’t helpful; it doesn’t help to build relationships, nor does it result in meaningful critiques of contemporary American culture.</p>

<p>I’m not going to spend this post attacking the culture wars, however. It’s tempting, but engages in exactly the flaw I want to critique: an inability to lovingly engage with someone who differs with, or is opposed to, my own beliefs. Instead, I want to think about ways forward, ways of moving beyond a culture war mentality. How can we have a faithful Christian witness without waging a culture war?</p>

<p>First, a brief summary of my position on the church in the world — since Christians have legitimate disagreements about how the two ought to relate to one another. I believe that the church ought to be interacting with the broader culture, rather than withdrawing from the world like the Amish (or Rod Dreher’s Benedict option). I also believe that the church should also stand distinct from the surrounding culture, finding a balance between withdrawal and assimilation. I see the church as distinct from the culture around it, but not removed from that culture.</p>

<p>But what is it that makes the church distinct? We must first answer this question, because without an idea of what makes us distinct we cannot consider how to best manifest that distinction within our particular cultural contexts.</p>

<p>I think the simplest, yet most profound, answer to the question of what makes us distinct is Jesus. We’re marked by our belief in him as Savior, by our belief (as we say in the eucharistic liturgy) that Christ has died, Christ is risen, and Christ will come again. Christians believe, as Paul says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10:9&amp;version=NIV">Romans</a>, that Jesus is Lord and that he has been raised from the dead.</p>

<p>But what does that even mean? Isn’t there more to our identity as Christians than affirming that Jesus is Lord and that he has been raised from the dead?</p>

<p>Well, yes — but it still comes back to Jesus. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13:14&amp;version=NIV">Paul</a> tells us <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+3:26-28&amp;version=NIV">twice</a> to clothe ourselves in Christ as we strive to live as Christians. John takes a slightly different angle, focusing on the love of God that is to flow through us; he <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3:23&amp;version=NIV">writes</a> that we are to believe in Jesus and love one another. Throughout the New Testament, the qualities we are to cultivate are those modeled by Christ and received through the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>And if we turn to Jesus himself, he tells us that all the law and the prophets are summed up in two <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22:34-40&amp;version=NIV">commands</a>: love God and love your neighbor. This sounds simple, but living into these commands is the work of a lifetime.</p>

<p>I don’t want to pretend that this is a simple, or an easy, answer to the question of what it is that makes the church distinct. We may agree that it’s Jesus, but what does that look like? How is it distinctive? And how should a life patterned on Jesus differ from the surrounding culture? Even New Testament writers like Paul and Peter draw on the Roman household codes as models for orderly relationships, indicating that the church’s moral standards may have significant overlap with the standards of its surrounding culture.</p>

<p>But the advantage of patterning our lives, our distinctiveness as Christians, on Jesus is that it frees us from comparisons to the surrounding culture. Imitating Christ may align us with cultural values or put us in opposition to them, and our call is to hold fast to Christ regardless.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to suggest that we can ever fully separate ourselves, Christian or otherwise, from the culture in which we live. But the great advantage of Christianity, in my mind, is the gap it creates between Christian and culture, since our ultimate allegiance is to Christ and his kingdom. In Wednesday’s post, I’ll turn to this gap and suggest some ways in which it can provide a model of cultural engagement beyond culture war.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Men, Emotion and King Arthur</title>

<p>Earlier this summer, the New York Times ran an article titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/well/family/talking-to-boys-the-way-we-talk-to-girls.html?_r=0">“Talking to Boys the Way We Talk to Girls.”</a> This article examines how parents and caregivers tend to limit the emotional vocabulary of boys, sending the message that boys need to develop emotional distance and stoicism. As the title suggests, the piece ends with a call to engage boys as well as girls emotionally — to let them experience and talk through emotions.</p>

<p>The examples in the article, and its modest call to support young boys as they experience and process the whole array of human emotions, won’t be revelatory to anyone who has reservations about modern American notions of masculinity. I read the article, nodded in agreement, and then I made the cardinal mistake of the internet.</p>

<p>I read the comments.</p>

<p>Although I shouldn’t have been surprised, a number of commenters — perhaps as many as half — expressed concern or even outrage over their perception that this article aimed to turn boys into girls. Many of these concerned comments noted that boys and girls are different, and argued that feminizing boys would create vague social ills.</p>

<p>These comments, of course, rehash the denigration of anything labelled “feminine” (including emotions) while also misunderstanding the article — which simply pointed out that we should teach both boys and girls emotional literacy, rather than attempting to restrict or suppress boys’ emotions (the article also pointed out that boys experience emotions, which should be unexceptionable but apparently isn’t).</p>

<p>These critical comments about the article also tended to reflect the prominence of what I’ll call the “Clint Eastwood” model of masculinity. This model prizes emotional distance in relationships and a stoic acceptance of circumstances; emotional reactions (or at least, reactions other than anger) are for women, not for men who want to be accepted and successful.</p>

<p>This model of manhood is open to critique on many levels, but I want to take a slightly different angle by looking at historical ideas of masculinity. Many of the comments on the article seemed to assume that men are naturally unemotional; ideal manhood, then, must exclude most emotions. However, ideal manhood has shifted in different cultures and times, and I want to look at just one example from the European middle ages.</p>

<p>Think, for a moment, of an ideal medieval man: I’m guessing that you thought of a knight in armor, on horseback, perhaps slaying a dragon. Maybe you thought of a real person, like Richard I (the Lionheart); perhaps you thought of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>King Arthur and his knights are fantastic examples of medieval masculinity, since these characters were shaped to reflect idealized medieval manhood when stories about Arthur and his knights exploded into popularity across Europe in the twelfth century.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> These knights are strong in battle; pious towards God; and courteous in their interactions with women, priests, and their social peers.</p>

<p>This form of masculinity probably remains familiar to most people. The ideals of chivalry persist today, even if they has been significantly reshaped since they emerged in eleventh century Europe. But one characteristic of these ideal medieval knights may be surprising: the frequency with which Arthur and his knights exhibit strong emotions, particularly grief.</p>

<p>For example, when Arthur’s beloved nephew Gawain dies in battle, killed by the treacherous Mordred, one version of the story <a href="http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/publication/benson-and-foster-king-arthurs-death">(the Alliterative <em>Morte Arthure</em>) </a>shows Arthur holding Gawain’s body in his arms as he weeps, eventually so overcome by sorrow that he faints. This does not lessen Arthur’s masculinity, but instead shows us how great a man Gawain was: his death deserves an emotional response.</p>

<p>In fact, in this version of the story, Gawain was such a great knight that his death even pierces the heart of Mordred. The worst of traitors himself retains enough humanity, enough chivalry, to be emotionally moved by Gawain’s death. Arthur and Mordred’s emotional responses to Gawain’s death do not undermine their chivalric masculinity but rather reinforce it, showing the depth of their respect for an ideal knight.</p>

<p>Lancelot also demonstrates a depth of emotion in Thomas Malory’s <em>Morte Darthur</em>, the fifteenth-century text that inspires many modern retellings of the Arthurian legends. Lancelot, for Malory, is the greatest example of medieval knighthood — despite his adulterous love for Guinevere. Malory’s Lancelot frequently demonstrates strong emotions, but one particular instance stands out to me.</p>

<p>One day, a wounded knight named Sir Urry arrives at Camelot. His wounds are severe and, under a curse, have persisted for seven years; they can only be healed by the best knight in the world. After all of the knights of the Round Table attempt to heal Sir Urry, Lancelot approaches the knight and, with only a touch, immediately heals him.</p>

<p>Rather than rejoice, however, at one more proof that he is the best, Lancelot weeps as if he were a child being beaten. Malory gives us ugly, complicated emotion: Lancelot has just failed in the quest for the grail and, against his resolve otherwise, has resumed his affair with Guinevere. And yet rather than being punished by God, he is allowed to work a miraculous healing. Is it any surprise that Lancelot exhibits strong emotion? And none of his companions say a word; his emotional reaction demonstrates his awareness of his sinful nature and his gratitude towards God that he is able to heal Sir Urry.</p>

<p>As with Arthur and Mordred in the other narrative, Lancelot’s emotion reinforces his status as a great knight. Were he not aware of his failings, were he not grateful that God still allowed him to work a miracle, were he not able to express his sorrow and gratitude, he would have been a lesser man.</p>

<p>These ideal medieval knights are hardly stoic; they publicly mourn as they experience loss or are confronted with their own sinful natures. And yet these emotions do not diminish their masculinity, do not lessen them in the eyes of medieval audiences.</p>

<p>Tracing the history of emotion and gender is, clearly, beyond the scope of a blog post. But I hope these two short examples — out of many more across time and culture — have demonstrated that idealized masculinity, even warrior masculinity, can certainly include space to experience and express emotion.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting a return to medieval chivalry. But it’s worth remembering that our current elevation of stoicism for men is cultural, not a reflection of biological reality. Models of manhood that we still admire, like the medieval knight, manage to incorporate emotion into masculinity.</p>

<p>Experiencing emotion is part of being human, whether male or female. Teaching boys emotional literacy can only erode their masculinity if we define masculinity in a way that excludes emotion. In reality, denying boys the opportunity to experience and express their full humanity, emotions included, denies their masculinity more profoundly than allowing them to be emotional beings does.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Christianity has always challenged the idea that ideal men are warriors; in the medieval church, priests and monks lived out an alternative masculinity based on prayer, study and piety rather than strength in battle or sexual virility. However, this never became the dominant model for masculinity and critiques of priests and monks sometimes focused on the alleged femininity of men in religious vocations.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

            <title>Why Feminism?</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><figure>

<p>When I was in college, I was determined not to be “that girl.” You know the one — she wore eyeshadow every day, curled her hair, painted her nails, cared about fashion. The shallow, boy-crazy one. The girly one. I liked logic and strategy games, and I preferred studying to shopping.</p>

<p>Now, part of my determination to not be “that girl” came from having been homeschooled in a small town in an era before YouTube makeup tutorials. I secretly envied the mysterious ability to apply eyeliner and achieve shiny ponytails, but it also seemed to me that there were two types of girls: those who cared about such things and the (better) kind of girl who didn’t. I was influenced by Jo March primarily, but also by Harriet Vane — not conventionally attractive, but able to captivate Lord Peter Wimsey through her intelligence and passion.</p>

<p>So I eschewed fashion, resigned myself to hopeless crushes, and spent Sunday afternoons playing Risk with my guy friends. I had a small group of girlfriends, but I was always reluctant to form friendships with girls who I judged as being too girly, not Serious and Smart like me.</p>

<p>At the time, I didn’t examine my preference for guy friends over girlfriends or question my assumption that “girly” was not only inferior but incompatible with smart. I did gain new friends in graduate school, though — girlfriends this time, including amazingly smart women who wore high heels and knew how to use mousse. I started, slowly, rethinking my assumption that traditionally “girly” things indicated a certain weakness.</p>

<p>It took me years to fully understand that my disdain of things pink and frilly was more than a personal preference and instead a reflection of internalized patriarchy. In western patriarchy, reason is superior to emotion and ideas superior to things — and men are associated with reason and ideas, women with emotion and the material world. I never experienced gender dysphoria, but I intuited from a young age that masculinity was superior to femininity and I shaped my interests accordingly.</p>

<p>Feminism has helped me to see the ways in which our ideas about masculinity and femininity affect all of our lives, regardless of whether we face blatant sexism. The denigration of things female, like “girly” interests in fashion or home decor, harms both women and men: men — even little boys — are discouraged from enjoying sparkly clothes and shiny nail polish, and at a deeper and more harmful level, discouraged from understanding and expressing their emotions.</p>

<p>In some ways, girls have it easier; they can enjoy both princesses and dinosaurs. But we still in many ways expect women to be more like men. Just listen to James Cameron’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/24/james-cameron-well-never-be-able-to-reproduce-the-shock-of-terminator-2?CMP=twt_a-film_b-gdnfilm">recent criticism</a> of <em>Wonder Woman</em>. He calls her an “objectified icon,” and compares her to <em>The Terminator’s</em> Sarah Connor: “Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit.”</p>

<p>Strong. Troubled. Terrible parent. Earned respect through grit. How many male characters could that apply to? And nothing against Sarah Connor — she rocks. But apparently for Cameron, Diana’s beauty and her compassion for humanity (and perhaps her idyllic, if unconventional, childhood) make her a poor role model for women. To be more clear: her <em>feminine</em> characteristics make Wonder Woman a “step backwards” in the representation of women on the silver screen.</p>

<p>I’m still not much of a fashion and makeup girl, and I’m okay with that. But I no longer see a perfect cat eye as a sign of shallow character, and I hope my daughters can value femininity in all its forms.</p>]]></description>
