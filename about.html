    <h2>About Into Resurrection</h2>

<p>I started <em>Into Resurrection</em> as a place to work through my thoughts and questions as I figure out what it means to live as a Christian in the tension between the world as it is and the coming kingdom of God. I began this blog after leaving, with many mixed emotions, a career in academia. I specialized in the literature of late medieval England, and I love the strange and wonderful world of the middle ages.</p>

<p>I’m a teacher at heart, and my favorite form of teaching is the seminar where questions and ideas flow freely and I leave as invigorated and inspired as my students. In the tradition of a seminar, I see <em>Into Resurrection</em> as part of a larger conversation among Christians, particularly former or dissatisfied  evangelicals, about what it means to be Christian. I have been influenced by so many who have begun raising the questions we must grapple with: Rachel Held Evans, Sarah Bessey, Rob Bell, Pete Enns, Christina Cleveland.</p>

<p>My training as a medievalist, while not an obvious entry point into blogging about faith, has helped me to understand different perspectives on the world — on history, gender, government, church, family. I can’t, of course, escape the culture in which I live, but I have a lot of practice in attempting to step outside my context in order to understand another point of view. I hope that this practice helps as I work through what it means to live into resurrection.</p>
